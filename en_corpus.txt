at this the bhagavat arise from his previous seat and
sit down on the lion throne with its great jewel lotus inside he sit with his leg cross and observe the entire gathering of bodhisattva
then to those bodhisattva great being he signal that he be about to deliver a distinguished dharma teaching
at that very time the entire assembly of bodhisattva have the thought
the youthful mañjuśrī should now inquire of the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha about non arising and non cessation we have not hear that dharma teach for a long time
the youthful mañjuśrī have understand the bhagavat ’s signal
and he also know what the bodhisattva great being be think
so he arise and adjust his upper robe so that one shoulder be uncover
he then kneel in front of the bhagavat with his right knee place in the center of a lotus
with join palm he then address this question to the bhagavat
bhagavat non arise and non cessation have be speak of
bhagavat to what dharma do the term non arise and non cessation refer
he also express his question in verse
of non cessation and non arising
guide you speak
greatly wise one how do you explain those term
non cessation and non arising
why be they call so
through analogy and reason
great sage please tell we
these many bodhisattva have come here
wish for awareness they be send to salute you
by many guide of the world
so please teach the lofty and excellent good dharma
the bhagavat say to the youthful mañjuśrī
you be strive for the benefit of many people for the happiness of many people and with compassion for the world
you be do so for the goodness benefit and happiness of a great group of being both god and man
you be also act so that the bodhisattva great being who have come here may obtain the level of a buddha
good mañjuśrī good
mañjuśrī it be good that you think to ask the tathāgata about this matter
you should apply yourself to this point without alarm without fear and without hesitation
and mañjuśrī you must rely on awareness
it be as follow mañjuśrī imagine that this wide earth be make entirely of beryl
so that in that beryl one could see reflection of the abode of the thirty three of śakra lord of the god and of his palace of victory
and imagine that śakra lord of the god could be see there play and enjoy himself with the five divine object of pleasure
at that time the god might call out to all the man woman boy and girl of jambūdvīpa
come here man and woman
look at śakra lord of the god as he be play enjoy and amuse himself with the five divine object of pleasure in his palace of victory
come all man and woman
offer gift and make merit
take up discipline and abide by it
hen you shall also get to play enjoy and amuse yourself in such palaces of victory
you will become like śakra himself and will come to possess wealth like his the lord of the god śakra have all divine enjoyment and so shall you
then mañjuśrī all those man woman girl and boy who could see the abode of the thirty three along with śakra lord of the god and his palace of victory reflect in the wide earth of beryl
would fold their hand toward this reflection they would scatter flower and offer perfume toward it say
may we also obtain such a body as that of śakra lord of the god
may we also play enjoy and amuse ourselves in the palace of victory just like śakra lord of the god
however those being would not understand that this would merely be a reflection in the wide earth of beryl a reflection occur due to the complete purity of the beryl wherein the abode of the thirty three along with śakra lord of the god and his palace of victory could be see
wish for the state of śakra they would then offer gift and make merit
they would take up discipline and abide by that they would then dedicate the root of what be wholesome toward birth in that reflection of the abode of the thirty three
mañjuśrī in that wide earth of beryl there would of course be no abode of the thirty three and neither would there be a palace of victory or śakra lord of the god
however due to the purity of the great beryl
the abode of the thirty three along with the palace of victory and śakra lord of the god would all be visible
non existent non arisen and non ceased their reflection would be see because of the purity of the great beryl
in the same way mañjuśrī it be due to the complete purity of the mind as well as due to proper cultivation that sentient being see the body of a tathāgata
mañjuśrī it be due to the power of the tathāgata that sentient being see he
and still he remain non existent non arisen and non ceased
he be neither existence nor non existence
neither visible nor invisible
neither worldly nor unworldly
neither an object of thinking nor not an object of thinking
neither existent nor non existent
it be so mañjuśrī that sentient being focus on the reflection of the tathāgata
and offer it flower perfume garment and jewel while make this aspiration
may we also become like the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha
wish for a buddha ’ awareness
they offer gift and make merit
they take up discipline and abide by it
then they dedicate that root of what be wholesome toward obtain a tathāgata ’s awareness
it be as follow mañjuśrī
the reflection of śakra ruler of the god on that wide earth make of beryl do not move
nor do he think elaborate construct or conceptualize
it be not a construct not a concept inconceivable and not a mental placement
he be peaceful and cool non arising and non cessation
not see not hear not smell not taste not touch
not a sign not a cognition and not something that can be make known
in the same way mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha do not move
he be not a construct not a concept inconceivable not a mental placement
mañjuśrī the tathāgata be in the realm of non arising
on the other hand he appear in the world as a reflect image
accord to the belief of sentient being he display diverse appearance and diverse lifespan
he appear among sentient being who have become fitting receptacle for awakening thank to their maturation and belief
these sentient being then hear the dharma accord to their disposition and belief
accord to their disposition they understand the three vehicle
it be as follow mañjuśrī
a great dharma drum for make sound of dharma which come about through the force of merit of the god of the thirty three
be place in the atmosphere above the vaijayanta palace
beyond visible range the divine scion can not see it or behold it
however mañjuśrī it be a great dharma drum
sometimes the god in the heaven of the thirty three become so intensely and continuously oblivious from play with enjoy and delight themselves with their divine pleasure
that they fail to enter the divine hall call sudharma to jointly chant the dharma
and mañjuśrī śakra lord of the god become so intensely and continuously oblivious from play with enjoy and delight himself with his divine pleasure
that he fail to sit on his dharma seat to speak of the dharma
mañjuśrī at such time that great dharma drum
not to be see or beheld hang in the atmosphere beyond visible range
play a dharma sound that address all the god in the heaven of the thirty three
friend form sound smell flavor and touch be impermanent
do not be careless
do not quickly fall down from this abode
friend all co produce factor be suffer
friend all co produce factor be empty
friend all co produce factor be without self
for those who die and fall from here to take birth here once again be difficult
do not become careless
delight in the pleasant joy of dharma
be incline toward the dharma
with dharma pour like rain recollect and place the dharma in the mind
you shall not then have to part from these divine enjoyment and delight in game of pleasure
at that time mañjuśrī due to the sound of that great dharma drum
invisible formless inconceivable not a mental construct
out of sight
unborn unceasing beyond the way of word
and devoid of mind mentality and consciousness
all the god in the heaven of the thirty three be rouse scared alarmed and very distressed
they enter the divine hall call sudharma
delight in the pleasant joy of dharma
they make the dharma their essence
they become inclined toward the dharma
recollect and keep the dharma in mind
when they die and fall from that abode they will again reach excellent place
śakra the king of the god then enter sudharma the divine hall
take a seat on the dharma throne and teach the dharma
mañjuśrī when the demigod battle against the god
whenever the god of the heaven of the thirty three be be defeat
the dharma drum emit a sound that make the demigod so frightened alarmed agitated and distress that they flee
nevertheless mañjuśrī that great dharma drum do not have a producer
nor do it have a body
mañjuśrī that dharma drum be invisible
not to be beheld not true
not real with no mind without intention
sign less
voiceless
immaterial
non dual
and out of sight
nevertheless mañjuśrī for those god in the heaven of the thirty three who have previously purify themselves
a sound come forth from the great dharma drum
it occur to pacify all the misfortune trouble and affliction of the god of the thirty three
mañjuśrī in the same way that from that great dharma drum
invisible
not to be beheld
not true not real with no mind without intention
sign less
formless
voiceless immaterial
non dual
and out of sight
that sound of dharma occur to pacify all the misfortune trouble and affliction of the god of the thirty three
so too mañjuśrī although the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha be invisible
not true not real
with no mind without intention
and out of sight nevertheless
mañjuśrī sentient being perceive the voice of dharma due to the maturation of previous karma accord to their individual aspiration and interest
and that sound of dharma occur to pacify all misfortune trouble and affliction of all sentient being
be the voice of dharma it be regard in the world as the voice of the tathāgata
mañjuśrī there be no tathāgata
however the designation tathāgata come about in the world because of the voice of dharma
it be exclusively due to the maturation of sentient being previous wholesome karma
that they perceive the voice of the tathāgata
that voice emerge in order to produce happiness for all sentient being and to prompt those who be careless
mañjuśrī as those sentient being hear that sound
they form the concept of a tathāgata think this be the tathāgata ’s body
the speech of the tathāgata be hear so that beginner bodhisattvas and all immature ordinary people may generate root of what be wholesome by take the tathāgata as their reference point
however mañjuśrī the tathāgata should be know to be non arisen and non ceasing
it be as follow mañjuśrī
at the end of summertime during the first month of rain
due to the maturation of sentient being previous karma
and to generate out of the multitude of seed and element all the grass thicket medicinal herb and tree on earth
wind begin to blow in the atmosphere and the sky above
then water come about due to that wind and it fall on the great earth
thus the great earth be satisfied
and all sentient being in jambūdvīpa be joyful and happy
refer to this the notion of a cloud come about in the world
mañjuśrī whenever not much rain fall from the atmosphere and the sky above
all the sentient being in jambūdvīpa think here there be not a cloud
but when mañjuśrī a lot of rain fall on the great earth from the atmosphere and the sky above
they say oh a great cloud be pour down water
satisfy the great earth
however mañjuśrī when this happen there be neither a cloud nor anything that can be designate as a cloud
a large mass of water be generate by the wind and then it fall from the atmosphere above
disappear in the atmosphere itself
mañjuśrī that cumulus of water above in the atmosphere stir by the wind and release water be designate a cloud due to the maturation of sentient being previous karma
mañjuśrī no cloud can be find there
nor anything that could be designate a cloud
mañjuśrī the cloud be non arisen and non ceasing
it do not enter the way of mind and it be free from come and go
in the same way mañjuśrī for bodhisattva great being who have accumulate previous root of what be wholesome
for other sentient being who wish for the awareness of a hearer or a pratyekabuddha
and for those sentient being who have accumulate root of what be wholesome and possess the cause to be show the path to nirvāṇa
the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha with unobstructed brilliance come to be count as arise in the world
whatever he say be thus tathā undistorted thus and not otherwise therefore
he be give the name tathāgata among god and man
mañjuśrī this word appear among god and man tathāgata
however mañjuśrī there be no tathāgata to be find
the tathāgata mañjuśrī be not a sign
and he be free from sign
he be unreal non arisen and non ceasing
on the other hand mañjuśrī the appearance of the tathāgata satisfie and entertain this world include the god
and then due to the ripening of previous karma of beginner bodhisattva and immature ordinary people who be guide by mean of nirvāṇa
they think the tathāgata have pass into complete nirvāṇa
however mañjuśrī the tathāgata neither arise nor cease
the tathāgata mañjuśrī be non arisen and non ceasing
mañjuśrī when some water be take as a point of reference for an unreal cloud
that have not arise nor cease and be non existent
the designation cloud be establish in the world in the very same way
it be as follow mañjuśrī
every day the great and unsurpassed brahmā who control ten trichiliocosm look upon all the class of god as far as the class of the god of the four great king
at that time mañjuśrī while the great brahmā who control ten trichiliocosm look upon all the class of god
they all abandon their game of pleasure delight and enjoyment
they respectfully fold their hand
and look toward the great brahmā without blink
for a moment the great brahmā offer sight of himself to all the class of god
at that time the god all long to be bear in the world of the great brahmā
and they dedicate their root of what be wholesome toward take birth in the world of the great brahmā
moreover mañjuśrī that great brahmā without fall down from that brahmā palace
thank to the power of his previous aspiration and due to the prior accumulation of virtue on the part of the god
empower another great brahmā as the controller of ten trichiliocosm
mañjuśrī that emanated great brahmā look upon all the class of god as far as the class of the god of the four great king
at that time mañjuśrī
among all the class of god all the scion of the god abandon their game of pleasure delight and enjoyment
they stop play their percussion instrument and halt their singing
shift their attention from their game of pleasure and delight
they respectfully fold their hand and look toward the great brahmā without blink
at that time the god all long to be bear in the world of the great brahmā and they dedicate their root of what be wholesome toward take birth in the world of the great brahmā
still mañjuśrī no brahmā be there to be find
mañjuśrī brahmā be empty dependent
unreal without syllable
without voice without place
and also not an existent thing he be inconceivable
without sign and free from mentality mind and consciousness
he be non arisen and unceasing
and yet mañjuśrī a semblance of he offer sight of himself appear among all the class of god by the power of his own previous root of what be wholesome and aspiration and due to the previous accumulation of root of what be wholesome on the part of those god
yet mañjuśrī those god do not think this brahmā be an emanation
empty dependent
unreal without syllable
without voice without place
not an existent thing
and free from mentality mind and consciousness
he be non arisen and unceasing
mañjuśrī in the same manner the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha be empty
dependent unreal without syllable without voice without place and also not an existent thing
he be inconceivable without sign and free from mentality mind and consciousness
this be due to the power of his previous aspiration during his practice as a bodhisattva and also due to the power of all the root of what be wholesome of the beginner bodhisattvas of those who set out on the vehicle of the hearer and the pratyekabuddha as well as of all the immature ordinary people
he be see in the world as a tathāgata adorn with hundred of thousand of mark like a reflect image and he do not move from his place
yet mañjuśrī from the body of the tathāgata adorn with hundred of thousand of mark during all the empty posture of a tathāgata
a great dharma teaching emanate for the sake of varied sentient being with diverse belief
that dharma teaching occur to pacify all the trouble harm and affliction of all sentient being
in that regard the tathāgata be the same neutral without concept and do not make any distinction
thus mañjuśrī through this explanation you should understand that non arising and non cessation be an appellation of the tathāgata
then at that time the bhagavat speak the follow two stanza
the tathāgata always have the quality of non arising
and all dharma resemble the sugata
yet immature mind by their grasping at sign
roam the world among non existent dharma
the tathāgata be a reflect image
of the wholesome dharma without
yet here there be no tathatā and no tathāgata
while an image be see in the entire world
it be as follow mañjuśrī
here in jambūdvīpa the ray of the sun only shine at first on the great king of mighty mountain
after that they shine on the cakravāḍa and mahācakravāḍa range
after that they shine on the elevated region of the earth
after that they shine on the low lie region of the earth here in jambūdvīpa
yet those sun ray mañjuśrī do not form mental construct or concept
they do not think or ponder
the ray of the sun mañjuśrī be free from mentality mind and consciousness
they be unborn and unceasing without characteristic free from characteristic
without mental placement free from mental placement
without elaboration free from elaboration
without torment free from torment
not abide hither not abide thither
not high not low
not bind not liberate
not know not ignorant
not affliction not free from affliction
not speak the truth not speak falsely
not over there not here
not on dry land not in the stream
not the domain of reasoning not the domain of non reasoning
neither with form nor formless
yet mañjuśrī due to the distinction of high middling and low place on the earth
the light shine differently at high middling and low degree cause varied shade
in the same way mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha do not form mental construct or concept
mañjuśrī the tathāgata be free from mind mentality and consciousness
not speak the truth not speak falsely
not on the shore nor on the non shore
he be not omniscient not non omniscient
not reasoning not non reasoning
not act not non act
neither mindful nor unmindful
neither with intention nor free from intention
neither mind nor without mind
neither originated nor unoriginated
neither name nor no name
neither form nor no form
neither verbal expression nor non verbal expression
neither a possible object of imputation nor not a possible object of imputation
neither visible nor invisible
neither a conducive way nor not a conducive way
neither lead along the way nor not lead along the way
neither having obtain the result nor not having obtain the result
neither a concept nor not a concept
neither free from concept nor not free from concept
similarly mañjuśrī the ray of awareness from the round sun of the tathāgata shine brilliantly in the three realm unimpede throughout the dharmadhātu with neither edge nor center
once they shine they first descend upon the body of bodhisattvas whose aspiration be like the great lord of mountain
after that they descend upon the body of those who set forth on the vehicle of pratyekabuddhas
then they descend upon the body of those who have set forth on the hearers vehicle
after that they descend upon the body of sentient being with wholesome aspiration accord to their specific inclination
after that the ray of awareness from the round sun of the tathāgata even descend upon the body of those sentient being with mental continuum that be stick in what be wrong
the ray assist all these being by produce cause for what will come later and increase their wholesome dharma
in that respect mañjuśrī the tathāgata be everywhere the same neutral without concept and do not make any distinction
moreover mañjuśrī the round sun of the tathāgata ’s awareness do not think i will teach this person the vast dharma
but i will not teach that one neither do they have the concept
this person have vast belief
that one have middling belief
this one have belief in the hearers vehicle
this one have wholesome aspiration
while that one be low with wrong aspiration mañjuśrī the round sun of the tathāgata ’s awareness do not think
this sentient being have vast belief so i will teach he the great vehicle
this one have middling belief
so i will teach he the pratyekabuddha vehicle
this one have belief in the hearers vehicle
so i will teach he the hearers vehicle
i shall come to understand the aspiration of sentient being with either wholesome or unwholesome aspiration
then purify they
and straighten up their view even for sentient being stick in what be wrong
the light of the ray of awareness from the round sun of the tathāgata do not have any such concept
and why
on the other hand mañjuśrī because of variation in sentient being inclination to wholesome intent the light of the ray of awareness from the round sun of the tathāgata be varied too
because the light of the ray of awareness from the round sun of the tathāgata have cut off all construct concept and elaboration
it be as follow mañjuśrī
in the great ocean there be a great precious jewel call fulfilling all wishes
i shall teach a fitting dharma
mañjuśrī when the teaching of the dharma be take as a point of reference for an unreal tathāgata who have not arise nor cease and who be non existent and primordially unborn
the designation the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha becomes establish in the world
in the very same way mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha do not form mental construct
it be inconceivable free from what can be conceive and free from mind mentality and consciousness
he do not think or ponder
he be not obtain not obtainable
he be inconceivable free from what can be conceive and free from mind mentality and consciousness
he be non grasping the act of not hold on
he have eliminate arbitrary truth as well as attachment aversion and delusion
he be neither true nor false
neither permanent nor impermanent
neither shine nor not shine
neither worldly nor non worldly
he be without deliberation or analysis he be non arisen and unceasing
he be inconceivable imponderable essence less and not possibly an essence
he be empty of non existence
he be not bliss
he be free from bliss
he be the destruction of bliss
when it be attach to the top of a banner
and a sentient being make a wish sentient being will perceive corresponding word come forth from the jewel however that great precious jewel do not form mental construct or concept
he be not a conventional expression
he be the cutting off of conventional expression
he can not be clung to
he be free from strive or give anything up
it do not think or ponder
he can not be count
he be free from count
and have cut off all conventional expression
he have cut off all movement
he be not movement he have reach non movement
he be not space
he be ungraspable
he can not be see or beholden
not lack of space
not an assemblage
and not a non assemblage
he be neither mentally construct nor not mentally construct
he be not visible
not to be describe
he be not establish show afflict or purify
he be not establish show afflict or purify
he be not name
not form

not the maturation of karma
he be not past
not future
not present
he be nothing whatsoever
he be without impurity
without syllable
without voice
not speech
beyond a voice
he be not a characteristic
he be free from all characteristic
not perceive inside outside or in between
and mañjuśrī the awareness jewel of the tathāgata be completely pure in its intent and be fix at the top of the banner of great compassion
accord to his or her inclination and belief a sentient be perceive a dharma teaching issue forth from that jewel
and in this respect mañjuśrī the tathāgata be the same neutral without concept and do not make any distinction
it be as follow mañjuśrī
sentient being perceive an echo issue forth as the intimation of someone else ’s speech
but that echo be not past future or present
it can not be perceive inside outside or in between
it be non arisen
and unceasing
it be not cut off
not permanent
it be not endow with awareness
nor be it without awareness
it be neither wisdom
nor not wisdom
neither knowledge
nor ignorance
neither liberation
nor not liberation
it be neither blameworthy
nor free from blame
neither recollection

nor not sit
neither sit
it be not the earth element
not the water element
not the fire element
and not the wind element
it be neither co produce
nor unproduced
neither free from elaboration
nor with elaboration
neither speech
nor not speech
and neither visible
nor invisible
it be without syllable
without voice
beyond voice
without comparison
beyond comparison
not a characteristic
free from characteristic
it be neither peace nor not peace
neither long nor short
neither sentient nor insentient
neither mental nor not mental
it be neither to be beheld nor not to be beheld
free from mind mentality and consciousness
not analysis
it be not deliberation
it be empty of the nature of see
it be non recollection
non mental placement
in all regard it be the same neutral without concept and do not make any distinction
it be beyond the three time
however
in the very same way mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha be not past future or present
he can not be perceive inside outside or in between
he be non arisen
unceasing
he be not cut off
not permanent
he be not endow with awareness nor be he without awareness
he be neither with wisdom nor without wisdom
he be neither knowledge nor ignorance
neither liberation nor not liberation
he be neither blameworthy nor free from blame
neither with recollection nor without recollection
neither place nor unplaced
neither sit nor not sit
he be not the earth element
not the water element
not the fire element
and not the wind element
and sentient being perceive it to be just that way
mañjuśrī the echo the voice of many sound come forth for sentient being with varied inclination as the intimation of the voice of many sound
not the water element
not the fire element
and not the wind element
he be neither co produced nor unproduced
neither elaboration nor non elaboration
neither speech nor not speech
and neither visible nor invisible
he be without syllable
without voice
beyond voice
without comparison
beyond comparison
not a characteristic
free from characteristic
he be neither peaceful nor not peaceful

neither mental nor not mental
he be neither to be beheld nor not to be beheld
he be non recollection
he be empty of the nature of see
and non mental placement
he be not deliberation
not analysis
and free from mind mentality and consciousness
he be beyond the three time
in all regard he be the same neutral without concept and do not make any distinction
yet mañjuśrī sentient being with varied belief perceive
yet mañjuśrī sentient being with varied belief perceive the speech of the tathāgata issue forth in accordance with their manifold inclination
the speech of the tathāgata issue forth in accordance with their manifold inclination
it be as follow mañjuśrī
it be through have the earth as their basis and support that all grass thicket herb and tree grow to become sizeable
but mañjuśrī the earth do not form mental construct or concept
with respect to everything it be the same free from concept
and free from mind mentality and consciousness
and free from mind mentality and consciousness
free from distinction
it be free from speculation
in the same way mañjuśrī it be through have the tathāgata as their basis and support
or of all tīrthikas such as the carakas parivrājakas and nirgranthas and so forth or of any other down to the root of what be wholesome of those stick in what be wrong it be through have the tathāgata as their basis and support that they grow and become sizeable
that all the root of what be wholesome of all sentient being grow and become sizeable whether it be the root of what be wholesome of those on the vehicle of the hearers on the pratyekabuddha vehicle or on the great vehicle
however mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not form mental construct or concept
or of all tīrthikas such as the carakas parivrājakas and nirgranthas and so forth or of any other down to the root of what be wholesome of those stick in what be wrong it be through have the tathāgata as their basis and support that they grow and become sizeable
mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha have cut off all mental construct concept point of reference and mental engagement
he be free from mind mentality and consciousness
he be neither speculation nor the domain of speculation
he be invisible
not to be beheld
not an object of thought or deliberation
free from thought
it be free from mind mentality and consciousness
with respect to all he be the same neutral without concept and he do not make any distinction
it be as follow mañjuśrī
space be everywhere the same
free from concept
and distinction
it be non arisen
and unceasing
it be not past future or present
it be indefinable
non elaborate
and formless
it can not be show
or make known
it be without contact
without dwell
not comparable
and beyond compare
it have no simile
and be beyond all simile
it have no basis
it be ungraspable
and beyond visible range
it have no characteristic
it be without syllable voice and mental engagement
mañjuśrī sentient being experience space as be low or high accord to whether the place be low middling or high
it be beyond the realm of word
it reach and enter everywhere and still
it have no striving or give up
no removal
no addition
he be without mental engagement
in the same way mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha be everywhere the same free from concept and distinction
mañjuśrī sentient being experience space as be low or high accord to whether the place be low middling or high
he be non arisen
and unceasing
he be not past future or present
he be indefinable
non elaborate
and formless
he can not be show or make known
he be without contact
without dwell
not comparable
and beyond compare
he have no simile
and be beyond all simile
he have no basis
he be ungraspable
and beyond visible range
he be free from mind mentality and consciousness
he have no characteristic
he be without syllable voice and mental engagement
he reach and enter everywhere
he be beyond the realm of word
and still mañjuśrī accord to whether sentient being be low middling or high
they see the tathāgata as low middling or high
mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not think
this sentient being have low inclination and belief so i will show he a low perfection of the form body
this sentient being have middling inclination and belief so i will show he a middling perfection of the form body
this sentient being have vast inclination and belief
so i will show he a vast perfection of the form body
mañjuśrī this be also what you should understand regard how the dharma be teach
so for he i shall make a speech relate to the hearers vehicle
mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not think this sentient being have low belief
this sentient being have middling belief
so for he i shall make a speech relate to the pratyekabuddha vehicle
no removal
no addition
he have no striving or give up
so for he i shall make a speech relate to the pratyekabuddha vehicle
this sentient being have vast belief
so for he i shall make a speech relate to the great vehicle
mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not think this sentient being have belief in give
so for he i shall make a speech relate to give
nor do he think so for discipline forbearance diligence or concentration
mañjuśrī the tathāgata be the dharmakāya
mañjuśrī the tathāgata be utterly non arisen
mañjuśrī for the tathāgata a consciousness chasing after name form and etymological explanation do not occur
mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not form mental construct or concept
mañjuśrī the tathāgata be momentary
mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not think this sentient being have belief in the perfection of wisdom so for he i shall make a speech relate to the perfection of wisdom
mañjuśrī the tathāgata do not think in that way
and his characteristic be to be inexhaustible
he be fix at the pinnacle of non exhaustion the pinnacle of reality
mañjuśrī the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha
be the pinnacle of the sameness of all dharma the pinnacle of their non duality and the pinnacle of their utter non arising
he be not low nor middling nor high
in all regard he be the same free from concept and free from distinction
they be not low nor middling nor high
it be because no dharma be perceive
mañjuśrī just in the same way all dharma be same free from concept and free from distinction
and why be that
mañjuśrī this non perception of all dharma be their sameness
mañjuśrī this non perception of all dharma be their sameness
their sameness be their remain fix
remain fix mean that they do not move
not move mean be without any abode
for someone with no abode in any dharma the mind have no place to stand
for a mind that stand nowhere there will be non arising
and for someone who see in this way no distorted mind and mental state come about
someone whose mind be undistorted will have authentic attainment
whoever have authentic attainment will not form elaboration
someone who do not form elaboration do not move about
when one do not move about one do not wander
when one do not wander one do not become distracted
one who do not become distracted do not oppose the dharmatā
one who do not oppose the dharmatā be in conformity with everything
one who be in conformity with everything do not move from the nature of the dharma
one who do not move from the nature of the dharma obtain the nature of the dharma
one who obtain the nature of the dharma do not form any elaboration
why be that
whoever be bear from condition and cause be utterly unborn
someone utterly unborn have gain certainty
whoever have gain certainty do not dwell with any mental engagement in the dharma
when one do not dwell with any mental engagement in the dharma one do not dwell with the dharma
when one do not dwell with the dharma one do not come into existence or go out of existence
when one do not come into existence or go out of existence one becomes fix and have obtain the dharma
when one becomes fix and have obtain the dharma one apply oneself to the proper dharma
when one apply oneself to the proper dharma no dharma whatsoever be not a buddhadharma
due to the realization of emptiness
the realization of emptiness be awakening
no sign
no wish
no dwelling
no effort
it be awakening because in this way one realize emptiness no sign no wish no effort no dwell no come about no object of apprehension and no abode
awakening be proper application
what be call proper application be to neither remove nor add
and why
and the application of what have yet to come
this be proper application
it be the non liberated application
and it be not connect
it be the application of not do and not change
the application of neither oneness nor plurality
because mind be by nature luminous
in that respect there be no application
no measure
and no direct realization of a result
it be afflict by adventitious affliction
but its nature be not afflict
luminosity by nature be non affliction
with respect to non affliction there be no counteragent a counteragent by which the destruction of the affliction may occur
because what be pure do not become pure it just be pure
that which be pure be non arising
non arise be faultless
what be faultless be the destruction of joy
whereby all attachment cease
where all attachment cease that be non arising
and non arise be awakening
awakening be sameness
sameness be the tathatā
all dharma co produced and unproduced abide in the tathatā
there be no designation of duality
with respect to the tathatā there be neither something co produce
where there be nothing co produced or unproduced and no designation of duality that be the tathatā
nor something unproduced
the tathatā be nothing else but the tathatā
nothing else but the tathatā be the unchanging tathatā
the unchanging tathatā be the non coming tathatā
the unchanging tathatā be the non coming tathatā
the non coming tathatā be the tathatā that do not go
the tathatā that do not go be the authentic tathatā
the authentic tathatā be the not at all tathatā
the not at all tathatā be not afflict
and be not purify
that which be neither afflict nor purify neither arise nor cease
that which neither arise nor cease be the same as nirvāṇa
that which be the same as nirvāṇa neither roam within saṃsāra nor pass into complete nirvāṇa
that which neither roam within saṃsāra nor pass into complete nirvāṇa be not past future or present
that which be not past future or present be not low middling or high
that which be not low middling or high be the tathatā
what we call tathathā be an expression meaning tattva
what we call tattva be tathatā itself
tathatā be the same as tattva be call tathatva
thus the tathatā and the self be not two they be non dual
the meaning of non duality be awakening in the sense of become awake
the meaning be explain as the awareness that enter the three gate of liberation with respect to all the dharma teaching
the awareness be explain as engage in the sameness of the three time with respect to all dharma
the meaning of the inseparability of all dharma be what be explain as the meaning
it be voiceless
ineffable
inexpressible
and cut off from any expression
awareness be explain as the awareness that understand the meaning and understand consciousness
this be explain as awareness
the meaning be explain as the meaning that be establish by the awareness that understand the meaning of tattva and by the awareness that understand consciousness
that itself be the dharmatā
and the dharmatā be the meaning
sameness be the meaning
mañjuśrī for those who have attachment to form the eye be attachment
know the nature of form and of the eye be non attachment
for those who have attachment to view one ’s own body be attachment
for those who have do away with all view the awareness of one ’s body ’s natural emptiness be non attachment
for those who be stick in their attachment to improper mental placement the appearance of dharma be attachment
discern the dharma through proper mental placement the awareness of emptiness by nature and emptiness of essence be non attachment
for those who be stick in their attachment to the stain of doubt liberation be attachment
the authentic awareness of belief and liberation be non attachment
for those who be stick in their attachment to the stain of laziness have present diligence toward realization be attachment
the realization of dharma as they be be non attachment
the realization of dharma as they be be non attachment
for those who be stick in their attachment to the hindrance the limb of awakening be attachment
liberation through unobstructed awareness be non attachment
be by nature completely pure all dharma occur due to an assemblage of cause and condition
the sameness of the interpretable meaning and the definitive meaning be their common meaning which be emptiness
because he be bear due to condition and cause
the sameness of liberation be the same as the sameness of the dharma
realization accord to the sameness of liberation be awakening
the sameness of the person be the same as the common meaning
the sameness of the dharma be the same as the sameness of person
it be sameness accord to the understanding of the meaning it be the sameness of awareness enter the gate of non duality
the non occurrence of the dharma and the sameness of meaning and expression be the same with respect to the non dual meaning
with respect to that a bodhisattva should understand well the cause of affliction and the cause of purification
he should neither abide with the purity of the cause of affliction nor with the purity of the cause of purification
elevate self be a cause of affliction
forbearance in one ’s engagement with the selflessness of dharma be a cause of purification
the view of i and mine be a cause of affliction
inner pacification and outer non movement be a cause of purification
thoughts of desire ill will and harm be a cause of affliction
emptiness
it be awakening because in this way one realize emptiness no sign no wish no effort no dwell no come about no object of apprehension and no abode
forbearance in one ’s dealing with impure thing in one ’s practice of friendliness compassion rejoicing equanimity and with dependent dharma be a cause of purification
the four distortion be a cause of affliction
the four placement of mindfulness be a cause of purification
the five hindrance be a cause of affliction
the five faculty be a cause of purification
the six entrance be a cause of affliction
the six remembrance be a cause of purification
the seven false dharma be a cause of affliction
the seven limb of awakening be a cause of purification
the eight wrong mode be a cause of affliction
the eight right mode be a cause of purification
the nine cause of antagonism be a cause of affliction
the absorption into nine successive abode be a cause of purification
the ten unwholesome course of karma be a cause of affliction
the ten wholesome course of karma be a cause of purification
in brief all unwholesome mental engagement be a cause of affliction
all wholesome mental engagement be a cause of purification
without a sentient being
without a live being
without one who nourish
without a soul or a person
without a master
without activity
comparable to an illusion without characteristic
pacify from within
in that respect whether cause of affliction or of purification all dharma be by nature empty
pacify from within they be utterly pacified
utterly pacified they be their intrinsic nature
their intrinsic nature be not be perceive
not be perceive be to have no abode
that which have no abode be thatness
thatness be space
and why
one cognize all dharma as the same as space one engage conventionally in the purification of affliction yet do not abandon the dharmatā of space
mañjuśrī no dharma whatsoever can be find for which there may be arise or cessation
mañjuśrī inquire
how then bhagavat do the tathāgata obtain awakening
the bhagavat reply
mañjuśrī the tathāgata obtain an awakening that have no root and no ground to stand upon
mañjuśrī ask
bhagavat what root would that be
and what ground to stand upon
mañjuśrī that root would be the transitory collection
and that ground to stand upon the imagination of what be not there
then mañjuśrī the tathāgata know the sameness of all dharma through the sameness of awakening
therefore it be say mañjuśrī that the tathāgata realize an awakening that have no root and no ground to stand upon
awakening mañjuśrī be to be at peace utterly at peace
in that respect what be peace
what be utter peace
inside there be peace
outside there be utter peace
why be that
the eye mañjuśrī be empty of a self and what belong to a self
such be its nature this be call peace
thoroughly understand that the eye be empty one do not run toward form
thus it be call utter peace
in the same way the ear be empty of a self and what belong to a self
thoroughly understand that the ear be empty one do not run toward sound
the nose be empty of a self and what belong to a self
thoroughly understand that the nose be empty
one do not run toward smell
the tongue be empty of a self and what belong to a self
thoroughly understand that the tongue be empty one do not run toward flavor
the body be empty of a self and what belong to a self
thoroughly understand that the body be empty
one do not run toward touchable thing
the mind mañjuśrī be empty of a self and what belong to a self
thoroughly understand that the mind be empty
one do not run toward dharma
the nature be not afflict
awakening mañjuśrī be by nature luminous because the mind be by nature luminous that be why it be say to be luminous by nature
it be the same as space
it have the nature of space
it go together with space
it be comparable to space
the nature be utterly luminous
awakening mañjuśrī be without strive or give anything up
in that respect how be it without strive
and how be it without give anything up
without strive mean not to grasp at any dharma
without strive mean not to grasp at any dharma
without give anything up mean not to abandon any dharma
in that respect mañjuśrī the tathāgata without strive or give anything up cross the stream
he cross it in such a way that he do not see this shore or the other shore of tathatā
thus he be call the tathāgata
therefore the tathāgata realize all dharma to be free from this shore or the other shore
awakening mañjuśrī be without sign or reference point
in that respect what be signlessness and what be the lack of reference point
that the eye consciousness do not perceive mañjuśrī be signlessness
that form be not see be the lack of reference point
that the ear consciousness do not perceive be signlessness
that sound be not hear be the lack of reference point
that the nose consciousness do not perceive be signlessness
that smell be not smell be the lack of reference point
that the tongue consciousness do not perceive be signlessness
that the body consciousness do not perceive be signlessness
that touchable thing be not touch be the lack of reference point
that the mind consciousness do not perceive be signlessness
that dharma be not cognize be the lack of reference point
this mañjuśrī be the scope of the noble one
that which be not the scope of the three realm mañjuśrī be the scope of the noble one
awakening mañjuśrī be not past not future not present
that flavor be not taste be the lack of reference point
it be the same in the three time and be cut off from the three sphere
in that respect mañjuśrī what do it mean to be cut off from the three sphere
the mind in the past be not perceive
consciousness do not run toward the future
consciousness do not run toward the future
mental placement do not occur in the present
one who do not abide in mind mentality and consciousness do not form mental construct or concept
one do not elaborate about the present
not form mental construct or concept one do not create the past
do not think of the future
awakening mañjuśrī be bodiless and unproduced
in that respect mañjuśrī bodilessness be what can not be cognize by the eye consciousness
what can not be cognize by the ear nose tongue body or mind consciousness
mañjuśrī that which can not be cognize by mind mentality and consciousness be unproduced
no abide
the unproduced be explain this way where there be no arise
no pass away
that be call the unproduced purified of the three sphere
and why
the co produce should be understand just like the unproduced
the essence of all dharma be no essence
in that respect there be no duality
awakening mañjuśrī be a basis of non division
in that respect what be non division
hat be the basis
no notion be non division
the tathatā be the basis
no ground to stand upon be non division
the dharmadhātu be the basis
non multiplicity be non division
emptiness be non division
the true limit be the basis
non apprehension be non division
non movement be the basis
no sign be the basis
non deliberation be non division
no wish be the basis
be without a sentient being be the basis
non essence of a sentient being be non division
space be the basis
non perception be non division
non arise be the basis
non cessation be non division
the unproduced be the basis
the unproduced be the basis
no move about be non division
awakening be the basis
pacification be non division
nirvāṇa be the basis
non development be non division
non birth be the basis
and why
awakening mañjuśrī be not realize by the body
nor by the mind
the body mañjuśrī be inert motionless and insentient
it be similar and comparable to grass log of wood wall or clay
the mind on the other hand can be compare to an illusion
it be hollow void unreal and unproduced
mañjuśrī to realize the body and mind in this manner be explain as awakening
this be base on conventional usage but it be not in the ultimate sense
mañjuśrī awakening can not be explain in term of the body the mind or dharma non dharma real unreal truth or falsity
awakening mañjuśrī can not be express through any dharma
mañjuśrī awakening do not have the slight location that allow it to enter conventional usage
in the same way mañjuśrī awakening have no location
space have no location
it be unproduced
non arisen
unceasing
can not be express
mañjuśrī when search for the real space it can not be explain through any dharma
mañjuśrī when search for the real awakening it can not be explain through any dharma
mañjuśrī with respect to what be real no word can be find because it be non arisen and unceasing
awakening mañjuśrī mean to be ungraspable and to have no abode
in that respect mañjuśrī what be it to be ungraspable
what be it to have no abode
what be it to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the eye mañjuśrī be to be ungraspable
the non perception of form be to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the ear be to be ungraspable
the non perception of sound be to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the nose be to be ungraspable
the non perception of smell be to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the tongue be to be ungraspable
the non perception of flavor be to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the body be to be ungraspable
the non perception of touchable thing be to have no abode
the thorough cognition of the mind be to be ungraspable
the non perception of dharma be to have no abode
in this way the tathāgata have realize awakening ungraspable and without abode
the eye consciousness have no ground to stand upon
not grasp at the ear and
not perceive sound the ear consciousness have no ground to stand upon
not grasp at the nose and
not perceive smell the nose consciousness have no ground to stand upon
not grasp at the body and
not perceive touchable thing the body consciousness have no ground to stand upon
not grasp at the mind and
not perceive dharma the mind consciousness have no ground to stand upon
therefore as his consciousness have no ground to stand upon he come to be count as the tathāgata the arhat the perfect and complete buddha
mañjuśrī there be four ground for the mind of sentient being to stand upon
which four
form be a ground for the mind of sentient being to stand upon
similarly
mañjuśrī feeling notion and co produce factor be ground for the mind of sentient being to stand upon
mañjuśrī these four ground for the mind to stand upon be know by the tathāgata to be non arisen and unceasing
mañjuśrī these four ground for the mind to stand upon be know by the tathāgata to be non arisen and unceasing
awakening mañjuśrī be an appellation for emptiness
mañjuśrī the emptiness by which awakening be empty be also the emptiness by which all dharma be empty
and the tathāgata realize they precisely in the way in which they be empty
mañjuśrī it be not that emptiness be realize through emptiness
there be one single method emptiness or awakening
and why
mañjuśrī where there be no emptiness there be no awakening
in that respect mañjuśrī there be no duality by which emptiness and awakening could be make into two
mañjuśrī all dharma be non dual
without characteristic not make into two
without name
without sign
free from mind mentality and consciousness
non arisen
unceasing
not act
not move forth
not occur
without syllable
without speech
mañjuśrī that which be call empty be an appellation for no attachment and no grasping
on the other hand mañjuśrī in the ultimate sense no dharma call empty be there to be perceive
on the other hand mañjuśrī
the sky be call sky yet the sky can not be express
in the same way mañjuśrī we say empty empty as an entrance to inexpressible empty thing
all dharma be nameless
yet all dharma be describe through name
mañjuśrī a name be not place in either a primary or an intermediate location
without characteristic
thus mañjuśrī all the dharma be know by the tathāgata to be from the very beginning unborn non arisen
free from mind mentality and consciousness
without syllable
without voice
they be know to be just free
it be not that they be first bind and then free
awakening mañjuśrī be the same as the sky
the sky be neither even nor uneven
awakening too be neither even nor uneven
and why
mañjuśrī a dharma with no real perfection can not be speak of as either even or uneven
therefore mañjuśrī all dharma be realize by the tathāgata as neither even nor uneven
they be realize in such a way that not even an atom be make even or uneven
dharma be cognize just as they be
and how do that accord with the awareness of reality
mañjuśrī all dharma non arisen and unceasing come into be after having not exist
just like awakening so also feel notion co produce factor and consciousness do not swerve from the tathatā
in that respect mañjuśrī what be a consistent basis
mañjuśrī just like awakening so also form do not swerve from the tathatā
in this way mañjuśrī they come into existence and go out of existence
thus it be say that the tathāgata teach the dharma for the sake of cut off the dharma
awakening mañjuśrī be a consistent basis
just like awakening so also feel notion co produce factor and consciousness do not swerve from the tathatā
just like awakening so also the earth element do not swerve from the tathatā
just like awakening so also the water element
the heat element
the wind element do not swerve from the tathatā
just like awakening so also the eye base
the eye consciousness base do not swerve from the tathatā
just like awakening mañjuśrī the ear base
the sound base
the ear consciousness base
the nose base
the smell base
the nose consciousness base
the tongue base
the flavor base
the tongue consciousness base
the body base
the touchable base
the body consciousness base
the mind base
the dharma base
the mind consciousness base do not swerve from the tathatā
and dharma can be designate
just as this the aggregate
the basis and
the entrance
and this entire set have be realize by the tathāgata as consistent
as it be before so also be it later and in between
it be unborn in the prior limit
not transfer at the later limit and
isolate in the middle
in this way for all those thing there be a consistent basis
just as one be so be all
just as all be so be one
and in this respect mañjuśrī neither oneness nor plurality be perceive
awakening mañjuśrī enter the aspect less by enter an aspect
in that respect mañjuśrī what be an aspect and what be the aspect less
the aspect mañjuśrī be explain as take up all wholesome dharma
the aspect less be explain as the non perception of any dharma
the aspect be explain as the stabilization of an unstable mind
the aspect less be explain as the gate to liberation of the samādhi of no sign
the aspect less be explain as the gate to liberation of the samādhi of no sign
the aspect be explain as think compare counting and thorough consideration of all dharma
the aspect less be explain as transcending comparison
what be transcend comparison
it be that with respect to which there be no function of consciousness
the aspect be explain as the thorough consideration of the co produced
the aspect less be explain as the thorough consideration of the unproduced
awakening mañjuśrī be without outflow and without cling
in that respect mañjuśrī how be it without outflow and how be it without cling
be without outflow mañjuśrī be explain as the absence of the four outflow
which four
they be the outflow of desire
the outflow of existence
the outflow of view
the outflow of ignorance and
be without cling be explain as the absence of four type of cling
they be cling to desire
cling to view
cling to posit a self
cling to one ’s attachment to discipline and vow and
being be blind by ignorance
craving disturb they
they develop mutual attachment and cling to each other
in that respect mañjuśrī the tathāgata thoroughly understand that the root of clinging be the position of a self
through self purity he understand the purity of all sentient being
the purity of self be the purity of all sentient being the purity of all sentient being be non dual not divide into two
and the meaning of non duality be non arising and non cessation
with respect to non arising and non cessation mañjuśrī mind mentality and consciousness do not come about
in that respect there be no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperly
in that respect there be no mental construct by which one may place the mind improperly
whosoever engage in proper mental placement do not give rise to ignorance
not give rise to ignorance mean not give rise to the twelve limb of existence
not give rise to the twelve limb of existence mean no birth
no birth be the fix rule
the fix rule be the definitive meaning
the definitive meaning be the ultimate meaning
the ultimate meaning mean to be devoid of a person
the meaning of be devoid of a person be the ineffable meaning
the ineffable meaning be the meaning of dependent arise
the meaning of dependent arise be the meaning of the dharma
the meaning of the dharma be the meaning of the tathāgata
hence it be say one who see dependent arise see the dharma
one who see the dharma see the tathāgata
and he see in such a way that when he search he do not see anything whatsoever
awakening mañjuśrī be pure stainless and without disturbance
in that respect mañjuśrī what be purity what be mean by stainless and what be non disturbance
emptiness mañjuśrī be purity
no sign be stainless
no wish be non disturbance
non birth be purity
non effort be stainless
non arise be non disturbance
the nature be purity
complete purity be stainless
luminosity be non disturbance
no elaboration be purity
freedom from elaboration be stainless
the pacification of elaboration be non disturbance
in this way the tathāgata have realize through their very sameness that all these dharma be equal
when one do not see the mind and the point of reference one then see reality
the pacification of elaboration be non disturbance
the tathatā be purity
the dharmadhātu be stainless
the pinnacle of reality be non disturbance
space be purity
the sky be stainless
the atmosphere be non disturbance
to thoroughly cognize inside be purity
not to move forth on the outside be stainless
non perception inside and outside be non disturbance
to thoroughly cognize the aggregate be purity
the essencelessness of the basis be stainless
put away the entrance be non disturbance
to cognize past destruction be purity
to cognize future non arise be stainless
to cognize the present abiding of the dharmadhātu be non disturbance
in this way mañjuśrī purity the stainless and non disturbance be collect within a single basis
the peaceful basis
that which be peaceful be very peaceful
that which be very peaceful be utterly peaceful
that which be utterly peaceful be utter pacification
utter pacification be call the sage
thus mañjuśrī just like space so be awaken
just like awakening so be the dharma
just like the dharma so be sentient being
just like sentient being so be the field
just like the field so be nirvāṇa
therefore mañjuśrī it be say that all dharma be the same as nirvāṇa
since this be their ultimate mode there be no counteragent
because there be no counteragent they be primordially pure
primordially stainless and
primordially without disturbance
it be thus mañjuśrī that the tathāgata realize all dharma to be as he observe the sphere of sentient being a pure great compassion that be free from disturbance call play come about toward those sentient being
mañjuśrī how do a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
mañjuśrī how do a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
nor be he disturb by utter non arising
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva do not think of destruction arising non destruction non arising and the utter destruction of destruction
and why
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva may practice think that form be not empty and also not non empty
form itself be empty of the essence of form
furthermore mañjuśrī a bodhisattva do not practice by think the past mind be destroy
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva
mañjuśrī give awakening and sentient being and on the other hand the tathāgata these be non dual
they be not divide into two practice in this way a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva

the buddha do not gain supreme realization
the buddha do not supremely realize any dharma
the buddha affliction have not be destroy

buddha have not see any dharma nor hear it smell it taste it touch it or cognize it
and why
because of the primordial purity of all dharma
such a person engender even more merit
all the more so for one who write down this dharma teaching or make other write it
mañjuśrī there be many sentient being to be find in the great trichiliocosm whether bear from an egg
bear from a womb
bear from moisture
bear suddenly
some with form other formless
some with notion other without notion
some without foot other with two foot
some with four foot or with many foot now imagine that all of they obtain a human body without precedent but not their last
once they obtain a human body they give rise to bodhicitta
having give rise to bodhicitta
each and every one of those bodhisattva attend as many buddha together with bodhisattva and hearer
as there be atomic particle in buddhafield as numerous as the grain of sand in the ganges
he collect all the necessity for their happiness
offer robe alm food bed seat herb that counteract illness and provision
for as many eon as the number of grain of sand in the ganges
pearl
with raise umbrella standard and flag
now imagine another bodhisattva with the right inclination who listen to this dharma teaching the ornament of the light of awareness that enter the domain of all buddhas and then believe in it engage with it trust it
realize it or teach at least one of its stanza compare to the bodhisattvas first mention he would engender even more uncountable merit that would lead he to follow the awareness of a buddha
compare to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consist of the bodhisattvas act of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
it would not even count for one thousandth or one billionth of it it would not even count as any part any number worthy of consideration simile or approximation of any kind
mañjuśrī imagine a householder bodhisattva who attend as many buddha and bodhisattvas
together with their saṅgha of hearer as there be grain of sand in the ganges for eon as numerous as the grain of sand in the ganges
he would offer they robe alm food bed seat remedy for exhaustion medicinal herb and provision
another ordained bodhisattva discipline and with the right inclination may give a morsel of food to a single sentient be bear as an animal
another ordained bodhisattva discipline and with the right inclination may give a morsel of food to a single sentient be bear as an animal
compare to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth part
together with their saṅgha of hearer as there be grain of sand in the ganges he would offer robe alm food bed seat remedy for exhaustion medicinal herb and provision for eon as numerous as the grain of sand in the ganges
mañjuśrī imagine as many bodhisattva as there be atomic particle in the great trichiliocosm all of they ordain discipline and pure in their inclination each bodhisattva would attend as many buddha and bodhisattvas
compare to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consist of the bodhisattvas act of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
it would not even bear approximation of any kind
it would not even count for one thousandth or one billionth of it
it would not even count for one thousandth or one billionth of it
offer it as a gift to the buddha the bhagavat
mañjuśrī imagine that a bodhisattva great be be to fill the great trichiliocosm with seven precious substance and
but another bodhisattva may teach just a four line stanza from this dharma method to another bodhisattva
compare to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance would not even amount to a hundredth part
it would not even count for one thousandth or one billionth of it
it would not even bear approximation of any kind
mañjuśrī consider that the production of merit of someone give offering be to continue for as many eon as there be atomic particle in a great trichiliocosm
mañjuśrī bodhisattvas as numerous as the grain of sand in the ganges would be there
each bodhisattva would cover as many golden buddhafield as the number of grain of sand in the ganges
all their tree with divine clothe and then cover they in net of gem and jewel shine in all possible way
he would then fill they with high palace make of precious vaśirāja gem
surround with vedikās of the precious vidyutpradīpa gem once fill he would give they as a gift with raise parasol standard and flag to as many buddha as there be grain of sand in the ganges each and every day
it be as follow mañjuśrī if all sentient being include in the three world sphere be to be bear in the hell or as animal or as preta in the world of yama
it be as follow mañjuśrī if all sentient being include in the three world sphere be to be bear in the hell or as animal or as preta in the world of yama
a householder bodhisattva may pull all of they out from those hell the animal realm and the preta world of yama and establish they in the state of a pratyekabuddha
but another ordain bodhisattva may just give a morsel of food to one sentient be bear as an animal
compare to the first the second would engender a great merit an uncountably great merit
by not grasp at the eye and not perceive form
the form base and
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva may establish as many sentient being as there be atomic particle in a great trichiliocosm into the state of a pratyekabuddha but he may still have no belief in this dharma teaching
another bodhisattva mañjuśrī who believe in this dharma teaching
engender much more merit than the first
all those bodhisattva would thus produce merit through their act of give
but another bodhisattva pure in his inclination and discipline whether householder or ordained
offer in this way he would give this gift for as many eon as there be atomic particle of dust in a great trichiliocosm
but another bodhisattva may teach just a four line stanza from this dharma method to another bodhisattva
in this way he would offer such gift for eon as numerous as the grain of sand in the ganges
but another bodhisattva may believe in this dharma teaching and
teach just a single four foot stanza from it to another bodhisattva
compare to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consist of the bodhisattvas act of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
he would then attend upon each tathāgata and the correspond bodhisattvas and hearer for as many eon as there be atomic particle in inexpressibly numerous ten of quintillion of buddhafield
he would offer robe alm food bed seat remedy for exhaustion medicinal herb and provision
compare to the merit he would produce the production of merit in the first instance consist of the bodhisattvas act of giving would not even amount to a hundredth part
and why
it would not even count for one thousandth or one billionth of it it would not even count as any part any number worthy of consideration simile or approximation of any kind
the seal of non return bodhisattvas be to hear this dharma teaching
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the state of one who follow out of conviction
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the state of one who follow the meaning
in that case the latter would engender incalculably great merit
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the state of one who follow the meaning
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the state of one who follow the dharma
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the state of one who follow the dharma
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the result of attain the stream
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the result of attain the stream
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the result of a once returner
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the result of a once returner
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the result of a non returner
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the result of a non returner
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the result of an arhat
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the result of an arhat
in that case the latter would engender incalculably great merit
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the result of an arhat
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the result of a pratyekabuddha
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the result of a pratyekabuddha
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in bodhicitta
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in bodhicitta
another bodhisattva might establish a single sentient be in the state of irreversibility
mañjuśrī a bodhisattva might establish the sentient being of all the world sphere in the ten direction in the state of irreversibility
at least cause a single sentient be to engage with this dharma teaching
another bodhisattva believe in this dharma teaching might make other write it down might shed light on it
then at that time the bhagavat speak the follow verse
if another listen with reverence to this sūtra
in the final time of decay a bodhisattva may uphold the good dharma of a hundred million buddha
his merit will be great and exceed the former
elicit compassion not crave for any pleasure
he may then salute all of those sacred person
if for just a brief moment another teach other this sūtra
will have sharp wisdom and great strength
the fruit of his merit will exceed the former
keep his mind well dispose toward the sugata ’s teaching
quickly reach the level of the buddha
have attain complete nirvāṇa without any remainder
this be translate edit and finalize by the indian scholar surendrabodhi the translator editor bhande yeshe de and other
he may establish tall and beautiful stūpas beautify with fine gem to the summit of existence
thus speak the bhagavat
this complete the noble mahāyāna sūtra the ornament of the light of awareness that enter the domain of all buddhas
here the body of the tathāgata like the space element be show to all
this sūtra be extoll by the sugata and uphold by many bodhisattva
his merit will indeed be immeasurable and he shall obtain awakening in accordance with his wish
remove all stain of miserliness and be without fear
if a bodhisattva uphold this dharma
then the fruit of his merit exceed the former
yet when hear this very sūtra a bodhisattva may form the wish to establish it well either within his body or within a book
with parasol standard and the sound of bell they would rise to the summit of existence
the sugata teach this sūtra a lamp for god and man
each bodhisattva everywhere within the ten direction would then see as many buddha as many bhagavat as there be atomic particle in inexpressibly numerous ten of quintillion of buddhafield
to each tathāgata each and every day he would offer as many world sphere as there be atomic particle in inexpressibly numerous ten of trillion of buddhafield after fill they with the precious vaśirāja gem
but another bodhisattva believe in this dharma teaching may give just one morsel of food to a sentient be bear as an animal
by use one ’s own special power someone may travel through the ten direction
and worship a hundred million buddha
they possess the assurance that overwhelm endless assembly
they be skilled in their emancipation from cyclic existence as they have demonstrate for many ten of million of eon

one who be without fixation perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the five psycho physical aggregate and likewise those other phenomenon up to and include the twelve link of dependent origination
what be the four application of mindfulness and likewise those other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
what be the emptiness that be a gateway to liberation and likewise those other attainment up to and include omniscience
what be the six transcendent-perfection and likewise those other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark
consciousness which arise contingent on formative predisposition
the zenith be empty of the zenith
while the nadir be empty of the nadir
that be call the emptiness of great extent
that be call the emptiness of ultimate reality
if you ask what be the emptiness of great extent
if you ask what be the emptiness of condition phenomenon
it be in this way that these great corporeal aggregate exclusively endow with suffer arise
great-bodhisattva-being resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that negative and non virtuous attribute which have not yet arise might not be develop
they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that negative and non virtuous attribute which have previously arise might be renounce
the power of recollection
correct effort
be emptiness as a gateway to liberation
this be call emptiness as a gateway to liberation
be signlessness as a gateway to liberation
the second aspect of liberation ensue when formless being endow with internal perception observe external physical form
the sense field of infinite space have be completely transcend in all respect and
when one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite consciousness think consciousness be infinite
the fifth aspect of liberation ensue when
and one achieve and abide in the sense field of nothing at all
the sixth aspect of liberation ensue when
and one achieve and abide in the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
the seventh aspect of liberation ensue when
the sense field of neither perception nor non perception have be completely transcend in all respect and
one achieve and abide in the cessation of all perception and feeling
the eighth aspect of liberation ensue when
the eighth meditative absorption ensue when
the sense field of nothing at all have be completely transcend in all respect
and one achieve and abide in the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
the ninth meditative absorption ensue when
the sense field of neither perception nor non perception have be completely transcend in all respect
and one achieve and abide in the cessation of all perception and feeling
it be the understanding of the aspect of the path
it be the understanding that one will not subsequently be reborn among the live being of phenomenal existence
this be call the knowledge that contaminant will not be regenerate
the emptiness of great extent
the emptiness of ultimate reality
the emptiness of condition phenomenon
the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon
the emptiness of the unlimited
the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
the emptiness of that which be not be to abandon
the emptiness of inherent existence
the emptiness of all intrinsic define characteristic
the emptiness of all thing
the emptiness of non apprehension
the emptiness of non entity
the emptiness of essential nature
nor on account of the emptiness of internal phenomenon do he consider that understanding to be anything other than clear realization
nor do he consider that understanding to be due to the attainment of clear realization of external phenomenon or due to the attainment of clear realization of both external and internal phenomenon
he do not consider that understanding to be inside physical form nor inside feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness
he do not consider that understanding to be outside physical form nor outside the other aggregate up to and include consciousness
in this manner the wander mendicant śreṇika resolve that intent on this sacred doctrine he would become a follower with faith in the understanding of all phenomenon
and that owe his non apprehension of all thing he would appropriate nothing at all since he have take reality as his standard and be not attentive to indication
since he do not make assumption about anything he do not make assumption even on the basis of nirvāṇa
the thing associate with the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the thing associate with the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
and similarly senior śāradvatī­putra the thing associate with the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the thing associate with the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the thing associate with the transcendent-perfection of generosity be non existent and non apprehensible
the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and the fruitional attribute from the ten power of the tathāgata up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be non existent and non apprehensible
senior śāradvatī­putra the six extrasensory power be non existent and non apprehensible
the real nature be non existent and non apprehensible
senior śāradvatī­putra the reality of phenomenon the abide nature of phenomenon the maturity of all thing and other unconditioned phenomena up to and include the finality of existence be non existent and non apprehensible
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they should investigate and make their determination accordingly
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti why should one know that these great-bodhisattva-being will never be separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly senior śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be without the nature of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the other transcendent-perfection
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
similarly if they engage with the notion that sign exist in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness or that sign do not exist therein then they be merely engage with mental image
if they engage with the notion that aspiration exist in physical form or that aspiration do not exist therein then they be merely engage with mental image
similarly if they engage with the notion that aspiration exist in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness or that aspiration do not exist therein then they be merely engage with mental image

if they engage with the notion that entity exist in physical form or that entity do not exist therein then they be merely engage with mental image
similarly if they engage with the notion that entity exist in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness or that entity do not exist therein then they be merely engage with mental image
venerable lord when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom if they unskillfully engage with the application of mindfulness then they be merely engage with mental image
in the same vein if they engage in the same manner with the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path then they be merely engage with mental image
in the same vein if they engage in the same manner with the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha then they be merely engage with mental image
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom think i be practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom i should cultivate it then they be merely engage with mental image
and similarly they be engage in the conditioning of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
when they engage in the conditioning of physical form and so on up to the conditioning of consciousness i say they will not be release from subsequent rebirth they will be agitate by aging and so on and they will not be release from suffer and so forth
moreover śāradvatī­putra if bodhisattva who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom unskillfully abide in cognize and be intent on the eye
and in the same vein if they abide in cognize and be intent on the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon i say they will not be release from suffer and so forth in subsequent rebirth
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
there be the meditative stability name unwavering   there be the meditative stability name transcendence of the range   there be the meditative stability name accumulation of all attributes   there be the meditative stability name abide without mentation   there be the meditative stability name blossoming and purity of the flowers of virtue
there be the meditative stability name endow with the factors conducive to enlightenment   there be the meditative stability name boundless inspiration   there be the meditative stability name equal to the unequaled   there be the meditative stability name transcend all thing
there be the meditative stability name utterly devoid of delimitation   there be the meditative stability name dispelling of doubt   there be the meditative stability name without settled focus   there be the meditative stability name single array
there be the meditative stability name manifest attainment of modalities   there be the meditative stability name unity of aspects   there be the meditative stability name non dispersion of aspects   there be the meditative stability name comprehension of/ dispersal of all bases of rebirth through realization
there be the meditative stability name entrance to symbols and sounds   there be the meditative stability name devoid of vocalic syllables   there be the meditative stability name burning lamp   there be the meditative stability name purification of defining characteristics
similarly they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be entity or that they be non entity
similarly the emptiness of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and the other aggregate
the nature of the application of mindfulness be indeed emptiness emptiness be indeed the application of mindfulness
in the same vein that which be empty of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
senior śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being when they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not accept that be practice do not accept that they be not practice
do not accept that they be both practice and not practice and do not accept that they be neither practice nor not practice
śāradvatī­putra for this reason when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they do not accept that they be practice
and in the same vein they do not accept that they be neither practice nor not practice and so forth
if you ask why it be because they have follow the principle that all thing have the essential nature of non entity and therefore they have not appropriate they
great-bodhisattva-being who be not separate from this meditative stability will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment

approach the blessed one they prostrate with their head toward the foot of the blessed one and stand to one side
then even as they stand to one side the god inhabit the world system of desire and the world system of form ask the blessed one
with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which the venerable lord be explain
what o lord be the define characteristic of this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
gods this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have the define characteristic of emptiness
and the define characteristic of aspirationlessness
god this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have the define characteristic of signlessness
similarly o god this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have the define characteristic of non conditioning
the define characteristic of non arising
the define characteristic of non cessation the define characteristic of non defilement
god although this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have such define characteristic for the sake of the world the tathāgata have name symbolize designate and express it in conventional term
it can not be disturb by the world with its god human and antigod
if you ask why it be because the world with its god human and antigod be also endow with those very same define characteristic
but o god that be not the case in ultimate reality
similarly o god define characteristic be not perceive by mean of define characteristic
nor be the absence of define characteristic perceive by mean of define characteristic
nor be define characteristic perceive by mean of the absence of define characteristic
nor even be the absence of define characteristic perceive by mean of the absence of define characteristic
therefore o god as far as define characteristic the absence of define characteristic the define characteristic of define characteristic and their combination be concern it be impossible for any of they to know and for any of they to be know
god these define characteristic have not be condition by physical form
they have not be condition by internal emptiness they have not be condition by external emptiness
nor have they be condition by external and internal emptiness and in the same vein
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form arise or that they cease
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be entity or that they be non entity
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be pure or that they be impure
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be fetter or that they be liberate
just as in the case of physical form so in the case of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that these be fetter or that they be liberate and so forth
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be past that they be future or that they be present
similarly he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be past that they be future or that they be present
in the same vein he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be past that they be future or that they be present
god these define characteristic be neither human nor non human
o lord they would be incorrect in state that such and such be the define characteristic of space
if one be to ask why
these define characteristic through which the tathāgata have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood be profound
venerable lord because they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with regard to those define characteristic
the tathāgata engage in the perception of pristine cognition which be unobstructed with respect to phenomenon
it be due to having be establish in these define characteristic that the tathāgata have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whose define characteristic transcend all attachment
god whether the tathāgata have appear
or whether the tathāgata have not appear in the world the expanse that be the define characteristic of reality be itself establish
the tathāgata be call tathāgata because they have genuinely attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
venerable lord how wonderful be this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom within the perceptual range of the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha the tathā­gata who become a bodhisattva in former life by engage therein and acquire the five extrasensory power of the bodhisattvas and who then in this very lifetime attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to omniscience and having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to omniscience comprehend all these define characteristic he comprehend the define characteristic of all thing
he comprehend the define characteristic of physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly he comprehend the define characteristic of the transcendent-perfection of generosity he comprehend the define characteristic of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
he comprehend the define characteristic of the attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
god the define characteristic of physical form be that they be capable of assume material form but the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of their define characteristic
the transcendent-perfection of generosity have the define characteristic of renunciation
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance have the define characteristic of imperturbability the transcendent-perfection of perseverance have the define characteristic of uncrushability
the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration have the define characteristic of undistractedness and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have the define characteristic of non fixation with respect to all thing
emptiness as a gateway to liberation have the define characteristic of emancipation signlessness as a gateway to liberation have the define characteristic of non grasping
aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation have the define characteristic of non striving equanimity have the define characteristic of non conditioning
the eight aspect of liberation have the define characteristic of non captivation the ten power of the tathāgata have the define characteristic of invincibility
the four assurance have the define characteristic of undauntedness great compassion have the define characteristic of kindness
and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha have the define characteristic of unsurpassibility but the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of their define characteristic
so it be o god that because the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of define characteristic in all thing
the tathāgata be say to perceive pristine cognition without attachment
then the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and it instruct they
therefore the tathāgata be establish intimately dependent on this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
as such they honor venerate respect and make offering to the doctrine of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha originate from this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and because the tathāgata be grateful and thankful for this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti if you ask how the tathāgata be grateful and thankful
moreover su­bhūti the tathāgata have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood know that the sacred doctrine be uncreated because there be no agent
similarly they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood know that all thing be uncreated because they have no corporeality
su­bhūti the tathāgata be indeed grateful and thankful because this manifestly perfect buddhahood be attain dependent on the profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover su­bhūti it be dependent on this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
not on nature or symbolic convention that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be bring to understand that all thing be uncreated
it be for these reason su­bhūti that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
in this sense su­bhūti it should be recognize that the tathāgata be grateful and thankful
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have speak all thing be unknowable and invisible
if you ask su­bhūti how all thing be unknowable and invisible all thing
all thing su­bhūti be unsupported and uncontaine
for this reason su­bhūti all thing be unknowable and invisible and accordingly
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
furthermore it be instructive because physical form be unseen
similarly it be instructive because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be unseen
in the same vein it be instructive because all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be unseen
so it be su­bhūti that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
moreover su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom indicate to these world that the five psycho physical aggregate be empty
similarly it indicate to these world that the twelve link of dependent origination and the false view about perishable composite which be the basis of the sixty two false view be empty
similarly it indicate to these world that the transcendent-perfection from the transcendent-perfection of generosity up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be empty
similarly it indicate to these world that internal emptiness be empty
similarly it indicate to these world that the four application of mindfulness be empty
and in the same vein it indicate that the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity be empty
similarly in the same vein as before it indicate to these world that the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be empty
that they comprehend know and cognize the world also to be empty and that they indicate as much to the sentient being inhabit these world
moreover su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom reveal to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha that the world be empty
if you ask what world it reveal to be empty it reveal the world comprise the five psycho physical aggregate to be empty
similarly it reveal the world comprise the twelve sense field to be empty
similarly it reveal the world comprise the eighteen sensory element to be empty
in the same vein as before it reveal the world comprise all the attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience to be empty
moreover su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom reveal to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha that the world be inconceivable
in the same vein it reveal the world comprise all the attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience to be inconceivable
so it be su­bhūti that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata
and instruct the world of sentient being
so it be su­bhūti that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
so it be su­bhūti that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
moreover su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom reveal to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha that the world be calm and empty of inherent existence
and similarly it reveal everything from the five psycho physical aggregate up to and include omniscience to be empty of inherent existence
so it be su­bhūti that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
moreover su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom reveal to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha the mundane perception that this world be without mundane perception and that other world be also without mundane perception
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because there be no phenomena through which perception could occur either in this world or in other world
senior su­bhūti then say to the blessed one
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of great deed
the blessed one reply it be so su­bhūti
it be just as you have speak
su­bhūti if you ask how this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of inconceivable deed
su­bhūti inconceivability denote genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata self origination and omniscience
for these reason su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of the inconceivable deed of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
su­bhūti if you ask how this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of unappraisable deed
su­bhūti there be no sentient being whatsoever among the five class of live being who be categorize as sentient being who can conceive of or estimate genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata self origination or omniscience
this be the power of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
for these reason su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of the unappraisable deed of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
su­bhūti if you ask how the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of innumerable deed
su­bhūti innumerable denote genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata self origination and omniscience
su­bhūti since there be no sentient being whatsoever among the five class of live being who be categorize as sentient being who be equal to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha how could any surpass they
only the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha can analyze these attribute by mean of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord be genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata self origination
and omniscience inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
the blessed one reply it be so su­bhūti
su­bhūti that which be equal to the unequaled
similarly su­bhūti physical form be also inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
likewise feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness too be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
in the same vein su­bhūti all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
su­bhūti physical form too be non existent be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
similarly su­bhūti feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non existent be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
therefore physical form be non existent while be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
similarly su­bhūti feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be also without limit
therefore consciousness and the other aggregate be non existent while be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
likewise su­bhūti all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be also without limit
in the same vein how be all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience without limit
similarly su­bhūti in the same vein as before
su­bhūti it be for these reason that all thing be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
su­bhūti all these attribute of the tathāgata which the tathāgata possess
therefore the attribute of the tathāgata be inconceivable
and free from concept unappraisable and free from appraisal and equal to the unequaled and free from parity with the unequaled
su­bhūti that which be unthinkable be designate as unthinkable
that which be unappraisable be designate as unappraisable
that which be innumerable be designate as innumerable
su­bhūti it be for these reason too that the attribute of the tathāgata which the tathāgata possess be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
for example su­bhūti just as space be inconceivable and equal to the unequaled
in the same way su­bhūti the attribute of the tathāgata be inconceivable and equal to the unequaled
indeed they can not be conceive appraise or quantify by the world with its god human and antigod
similarly the attribute which the tathāgata possess be innumerable
the mind of two hundred fully ordain nun be liberate from contaminant and free from grasp
six hundred layman and three hundred laywoman develop the unobscured and immaculate eye of the sacred doctrine
this complete the twentieth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle enlightened attributes
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of deed that be equal to the unequaled and so forth
they should not appropriate or become fixate on any attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
then the god inhabit the world system of desire and those inhabit the world system of form say to the blessed one
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be profound hard to discern and hard to realize
it can not be investigate and it be not within the range of sophistry
it can be know by the wise and by those skilled in examine its subtlety
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who have hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and form aspiration regard it include those who fulfil their high deed in the presence of former conqueror
those who have plant the root of virtuous action and those who have be accept by spiritual mentor
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be profound
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of great deed
the ten power of the tathāgata be subsume within it
in the same way su­bhūti all the doctrine of the śrāvaka
or all the doctrine of the pratyekabuddha or all the doctrine of the bodhisattvas
or all the doctrine of the genuinely perfect buddha as many as they be be subsume within the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and it be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which implement they
so for these reason su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of great deed
the blessed one continue su­bhūti do you consider those attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon no venerable lord
likewise i also do not consider those feeling those perception those formative predisposition and those mode of consciousness that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon
it be their cognition and exertion that will be great not the cognition and exertion of those who have become follower through faith those who have become pratyekabuddha and so forth
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the great transcendent-perfection
venerable lord having train in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom those who have become follower through faith
those who have reach the eighth level
those who have enter the stream
those who be tie to one more rebirth
those who be no long subject to rebirth
those who have attain arhatship
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable lord when those individual who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have hear this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
and the god inhabit the world system of form proceed to the world system of form
the god inhabit the world system of desire proceed to the world system of desire
having go not very far they depart through their miraculous power and become invisible
rejoice they prostrate with their head toward the foot of the blessed one and circumambulate he three time before depart from his presence
then the god extoll the teaching of the blessed one
and those who have become pratyekabuddha will all attain emancipation in the expanse of nirvāṇa in which no residue of the psycho physical aggregate be leave behind
having train therein great-bodhisattva-being will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
and as before commit it to write retain hold and master it and be always attentive to it in the correct manner
they will always follow in pursuit from whence they come to hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti just as a milch cow follow after her new bear calf
if you ask why
su­bhūti there be individual follow the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have honor the lord buddhas in other buddhafield
and similarly have retain hold
master
and be attentive to it in the correct manner and so forth
moreover su­bhūti there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom among the god realm of tuṣita and so forth
and who have be attentive to it in the correct manner and so forth
you should know that henceforth by put an end to the accumulation of non virtuous action
and by mean of these root of virtuous action which be associate with hear the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have be bear in the abode of tuṣita
and by cultivate the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they have be reborn therein with fortune equal to that of humankind and they be also endow with those same attribute
and then have pass away to be reborn in this human world
where they hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and immediately after hear it form aspiration toward it
and having form aspiration commit it to write have it commit to writing
and similarly retain hold master and be attentive to it in the correct manner
and who when they now hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
harbor doubt dullness hesitation and disillusionment with regard to this same profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover su­bhūti there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who in former life have hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and even experientially cultivate it and meditate upon it for a single day or for two day or for three four or five day but who be not captivate by this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and indeed subsequently succumb to hesitation
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because those individual who lack an earnest focus without cultivate those sacred doctrine and without earnestly apply they will turn out like that
the three gateway to liberation
the ten power of the tathāgata
the eight aspect of liberation
the nine serial step of meditative absorption
the five faculty
the five power
the seven branch of enlightenment
the noble eightfold path
similarly they have not train in the emptiness of internal phenomenon
and they have not train in the other aspect of emptiness]—the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of external and internal phenomenon and so forth up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly they have not train in the application of mindfulness
if you ask why
su­bhūti if those follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas do not commit this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write
or do not have it commit to writing
if they do not retain hold and master it
and if they do not read it aloud recite it confer its transmission and be not attentive to it in the correct manner
then you should know that they will be restrict to two level the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
but instead benefit no sentient being through this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and fail to encourage sentient being to acquire the attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
nor recite it
and who do not confer its transmission
and be not attentive to it in the correct manner
in the same way su­bhūti those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have a modicum of faith
and a modicum of joy with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but who do not commit this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to writing
do not have it commit to writing do not retain hold or master it
who do not read it aloud or recite it confer its transmission or be attentive to it in the correct manner
and who do not apply themselves earnestly as instruct in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
will actualize the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha without reach the maturity of the bodhisattvas
and who commit this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write
similarly retain
hold
and master it
read it aloud
and recite it
confer its transmission
be attentive to it in the correct manner
and apply themselves earnestly as instruct in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will not degenerate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom omniscience and so forth
having bring sentient being to maturity
and having even refine the buddhafield they will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
moreover su­bhūti you should know that this be like when a man or woman think of fetch water in a clay jar that have not be fire that man or woman would be unskille in nature
the unfired jar could not last long and would swiftly disintegrate into common clay
if you ask why it be because the jar be unfire and because it be soft
and who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain
but who nonetheless lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be unskille
and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
su­bhūti what be the interim state with which those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have degenerate from those superior attribute due to their inappropriate action be only associate
they be the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
that jar will not disintegrate even though it be often immerse in water
and it can be use to fetch water whenever the man or woman wish
and who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain
be not separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva without lack skillful mean
su­bhūti other bodhisattva apart from they should know that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have be favor by the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
those great-bodhisattva-being will not owe to inappropriate action degenerate from those superior attribute only to the interim state the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
uninjured and unharmed they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti it be like when an ocean go ship that have not be well construct set out to cross the ocean fill with merchandise
su­bhūti those merchant who act accordingly unskille in mean will incur great misfortune and suffer a decline in their prosperity
those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will only achieve an interim state and owe to inappropriate conduct they will incur great misfortune and suffer a decline with respect to the doctrine
that be to say they will experience a decline in the prosperity of the precious jewel of the sacred doctrine of the unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddha
su­bhūti if you ask in which interim state those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas suffer a decline with respect to the doctrine
it comprise the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
and load it so that it be full of various merchandise
su­bhūti other apart from that maritime merchant who be skilled in mean should know that for that reason this ship will not disintegrate in the ocean and will safely and securely reach the destination which that skilled merchant intend
in the same way su­bhūti when individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who be endow with faith tolerance
confidence high aspiration willingness volition and renunciation
and who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain be not separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
those great-bodhisattva-being will
owe to inappropriate action simply regress from those superior attribute to the interim state which comprise the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
if you ask why it be because they be without the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they be without skill in mean
and who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain be not separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva without lack skill in mean
even if he be capable of stand up venerable lord he would not be able to walk for more than one two or three krośa
in the same way su­bhūti
when those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva be endow with faith tolerance confidence high aspiration willingness volition and renunciation
and relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain
but be not separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and be not without skill in mean
such great-bodhisattva-being will exclusively not regress from those superior attribute in the interim until they attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
and similarly who maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance
and become equipoise in meditative concentration while they lack skill in mean and who cultivate wisdom while they lack skill in mean
i should give gift to they
and who then think i be give gift
i should give these gift
and similarly i be maintain ethical discipline
i possess ethical discipline
i be cultivate tolerance
i possess meditative concentration
i be cultivate wisdom
they make assumption that the gift be theirs
they make assumption on account of those gift
and they make assumption about those gift
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because in the transcendent-perfection of generosity there be no such concept
if you ask why it be because the transcendent-perfection of generosity be not a transcendent-perfection
if they have not be favor by those six transcendent-perfection
su­bhūti such be the individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who lack skill in mean
they do not make assumption on account of the act of wisdom
and so forth and they do not make assumption about the act of wisdom and so forth
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because in the transcendent-perfection of generosity there be no such concept and so they do not make assumption
if you ask why it be because the transcendent-perfection of generosity be not a transcendent-perfection
so it be that those bodhisattvas have the prescience to know that these be not transcendent-perfection
and they be consequently favor by the transcendent-perfection of generosity
they be excellently favor by omniscience
excellently favor in this way they also attain omniscience without regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
accordingly su­bhūti those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva be skilled in mean
without regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha they will indeed attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti beginner bodhisattva who wish to train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly whatever ethical discipline you keep whatever tolerance you cultivate whatever perseverance you undertake whatever meditative concentration you be equipoise in and whatever wisdom you cultivate
you should dedicate all these make common cause with all sentient being and without apprehend anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
similarly you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as physical form
similarly you should not misconstrue it as feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness
you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
you should not misconstrue it as the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the emptiness of internal phenomenon as the emptiness of external phenomenon as the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon or as the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
su­bhūti beginner bodhisattva should train accordingly in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this complete the twenty first chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle early indications
come son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
in the same vein as before
similarly if they have not misconstrue the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly if they have not misconstrue feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness they will subsequently attain this omniscience
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti if in that manner they have not misconstrue physical form they will subsequently attain this omniscience
you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the fruitional attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity they will subsequently attain this omniscience
in the same vein if they have not misconstrue the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha they will subsequently attain this omniscience
moreover su­bhūti bodhisattvas should grant instruction and admonition as follow to those beginner bodhisattva who wish to train in the demonstration of this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
o child of enlighten heritage when you conduct yourselves in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not generate desire for physical form do not generate desire for feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
if you ask why o child of enlighten heritage it be because physical form be without desire and be not an object of desire
so too be feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly o child of enlighten heritage when you practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not generate desire for the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the path they will subsequently attain this omniscience
do not generate desire for the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of external phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
and in the same vein do not generate desire for the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
again in the same vein o child of enlighten heritage do not generate desire for the attainment up to and include omniscience
if you ask why o child of enlighten heritage it be because omniscience and so forth be without desire and be not an object of desire
o child of enlighten heritage do not generate desire for the fruit of enter the stream
similarly do not generate desire for the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment
o child of enlighten heritage do not generate desire for the maturity of the bodhisattvas and for unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why o child of enlighten heritage it be because unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and those other fruit be without desire and be not an object of desire
if you ask why that be the case o child of enlighten heritage it be because all thing be empty of inherent existence
the blessed one reply it be so su­bhūti
it be just as you have say
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being embark sentient being for the well being of the world
similarly it be in order to release all sentient being from suffer that they engage in all the ethical discipline that they keep all the tolerance that they cultivate all the perseverance that they undertake all the meditative concentration in which they be equipoise and all the wisdom that they cultivate
su­bhūti the bodhisattvas bestow all their gift in order to release all sentient being from suffer
if you ask su­bhūti how bodhisattvas embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the benefit of the world in this regard
so they set out for unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment say let we become a sanctuary for the world a protector a refuge an ally an island a torch bearer a lamp a helmsman a guide and a support
even so su­bhūti having understand that all thing be like a magical display and dreamlike great-bodhisattva-being embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the benefit well being and happiness of the world of sentient being
they also encourage all sentient being establish they in the acquisition of the six transcendent-perfection
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being set out sentient being for the well being of the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being embark sentient being for the happiness of the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being be worthy to act as a refuge for the world in this regard
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being teach the sacred doctrine that be without support
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being behold those sentient being who be bear in the three low realm
and protect they from those low realm establish they also in the acquisition of calm abiding
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being act as a protector of the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being act as a protector of the world in this regard
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being become a sanctuary for the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being become a sanctuary for the world
it be because sentient being deserve to be offer sanctuary and because the bodhisattvas escort they to the citadel of fearlessness
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being set out sentient being for the happiness of the world
that be to say they do not depend on physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and they release those sentient being who have hear this doctrine from birth aging death sorrow lamentation suffering discomfort and agitation
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being be worthy to act as a refuge for the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being act as an ally of the world in this regard
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being teach the sacred doctrine as follow to those sentient being who be skilled in the aspect of the path and to those who have embark on negative path

and in the same vein the transcendence of all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be not the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and the rest
su­bhūti all thing indeed accord with this transcendence of all thing
venerable lord be it not the case that great-bodhisattva-being would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all phenomenon
this su­bhūti be the most difficult task of great-bodhisattva-being
although they indeed ascertain how calm and how profound these phenomenon all be they do not become discouraged but think let we attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to these phenomenon
then after we have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in that manner
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being be an island unto the world
these be feeling these be perception these be formative predisposition these be consciousness
it be just as you have say
su­bhūti all thing be confine by these delimiting phenomenon comprise the limit of the past and the limit of the future
su­bhūti that which confine all thing by the limit of the past and the limit of the future be definitively calm and excellent
that be to say it be also know as emptiness non apprehension the termination of the path the exhaustion of craving the non residual state dispassion cessation and nirvāṇa
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being be an island unto the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being act as a torch bearer and lamp of the world
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being act as a torch bearer and lamp of the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being act as a helmsman and guide of the world
similarly after attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment they reveal to sentient being the sacred doctrine that physical form neither arise nor cease and that they be neither defile nor purified
in the same way they reveal to sentient being the sacred doctrine that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness neither arise nor cease and that they be neither defile nor purified
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being act as a helmsman and guide of the world
if you ask su­bhūti how great-bodhisattva-being act as a support of the world
in the same vein as before they teach the sacred doctrine that all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience have the modality of space
moreover they teach sentient being the sacred doctrine that future physical form be emptiness that they will arise from nowhere and that they will proceed to nowhere
in the same vein they teach sentient being the sacred doctrine that future attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be all emptiness that they will arise from nowhere and that they will proceed to nowhere
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being act as a support of the world
if you ask why it be because all thing have the modality of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because in emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness go or come be non apprehensible
su­bhūti in that which neither arise nor cease and be neither defile nor purified go or come be non apprehensible
su­bhūti in thing which neither arise nor cease
and be neither defile nor purified go or come be non apprehensible
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because in a magical display the reflection of the moon in water a dream an optical aberration an echo and a phantom go or come be non apprehensible
su­bhūti all thing have a modality that be neither diminish nor enhance great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality

moreover su­bhūti all thing have a modality that be permanent and impermanent
similarly su­bhūti all thing have a modality that be imbue with happiness and a modality that be imbue with suffering
a modality that be a self and a modality that be not a self a modality that be empty and a modality that be not empty
a modality that be with sign and a modality that be signless a modality that have aspiration
and a modality that lack aspiration a modality that be calm and a modality that be void a modality that be afflict and a modality that be purify
a modality that arise and a modality that be non arising a modality that cease and a modality that be unceasing
a modality that be an entity and a modality that be non entity and a modality that be attractive
su­bhūti all thing have the basis of desire the basis of hatred and the basis of delusion great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the basis of desire the basis of hatred and the basis of delusion never exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come and go
su­bhūti all thing have the basis of the variety of false view great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the basis of the variety of false view never exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come and go
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the real nature the expanse of reality the finality of existence sameness and the inconceivable expanse never exist and they be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come and go
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because physical form do not exist and be non apprehensible similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness do not exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come and go
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of generosity great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
this be the case how could there possibly be a transcendent-perfection of this generosity
su­bhūti it be because the emptiness of internal phenomenon never exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come or go
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity and the rest never exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come or go
su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the application of mindfulness
and in the same vein su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the fruit of enter the stream
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
similarly the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship
su­bhūti all the attribute of the buddha have the modality of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord who will have conviction in and concur with this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be so profound
if you ask why it be because the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha never exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come or go
who have cultivate the root of virtuous action and who have be accept by a spiritual mentor will have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
what will be the indication of those great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will have the modality of omniscience
similarly there be those who owe to their skill in mean cultivate wisdom and so forth with a mind that do not resort to notion of i and mine
when they give gift they do not think i be give gift i should give these gift
these be the recipient to whom i should give the gift
and similarly i be maintain ethical discipline
i possess ethical discipline
i be cultivate tolerance
i possess tolerance
i be undertake perseverance
i possess perseverance
i be absorb in meditative concentration
i possess meditative concentration
i be cultivate wisdom
they do not make assumption with regard to those gift
they do not make assumption on account of those gift
they do not make assumption on account of the act of generosity
and they do not make assumption about the act of generosity
su­bhūti the essential nature of the mind of those great-bodhisattva-being who have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will be discipline with respect to desire hatred and delusion
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will be free from the indication sign and form of desire hatred and delusion
and venerable lord be this non cultivation of all thing indeed the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of physical form feeling perception formative predisposition consciousness the six inner sense field the six outer sense field and the eighteen sensory element
will have the modality of omniscience
in the same vein the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one then reply su­bhūti it be so
it be just as you have say
the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of physical form
the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the eye
the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the sensory element of the eye
the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of sight
the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the application of mindfulness
in the same vein the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the ten power of the tathāgata
in the same vein the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the non cultivation of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then the blessed one far address senior su­bhūti as follow
similarly they be not fixate on the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
in the same vein they be not fixate on attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
some great-bodhisattva-being when they practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
some great-bodhisattva-being when they practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will not be separate from the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and they will not be separate from the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and having study it they will retain it hold it master it and be attentive to it in the appropriate manner
similarly you should know that when these great-bodhisattva-being be successful in their practice their realization will be irreversible
those same great-bodhisattva-being in their former life too will have study this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom ask question and counter question about it retain it master it and be attentive to it in the appropriate manner
they should conduct themselves with their mind intent on emptiness and similarly with their mind intent on signlessness and aspirationlessness
when they practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with their mind intent on the simile of magical display mirage moon ’s reflection in water dream optical aberration echo phantom and so forth
venerable lord do those great-bodhisattva-being engage with physical form
or similarly do they engage with feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein do they engage with all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
and they do not engage with feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not engage with any attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti this omniscience have not be create by anyone nor have it be transform
it have not come from anywhere and it will not go anywhere
it do not abide in anything nor do it abide in any place nor do it abide in any direction
therein neither number nor calculation be apprehensible
and there be no one indeed who can attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to that in which number and calculation be non apprehensible
and the real nature of omniscience be one and the same real nature
similarly the real nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and the real nature of omniscience be one and the same real nature
venerable lord
this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be hard to realize
it can not be scrutinize it be not within the range of sophistry
and it may be know by the wise and by those who be skilled in investigate subtle quiescence
venerable lord
this complete the twenty second chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle cultivation
the enlightenment of the lord buddhas reveal in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be incompatible with all mundane phenomena

in the same vein all attribute up to and include enlightenment be non arising even the attribute of the buddha be non arising
if that be so those who enter the stream would already have attain the fruit of enter the stream
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti as i understand the meaning of your word physical form be non arising similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non arising

if one be to ask how this sacred doctrine be compatible with all thing this sacred doctrine be compatible with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
similarly this sacred doctrine be compatible with the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the transcendent-perfection of generosity

this sacred doctrine be compatible with the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the fruit of arhatship
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the fruit of individual enlightenment
similarly it be unobstructed with regard to feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and similarly owe to the non apprehension of the ground of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and similarly owe to the non apprehension of the arise of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and similarly owe to its sameness with emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
and owe to its sameness with non arising non cessation non affliction and non purification
then the god inhabit the world system of desire and those inhabit the world system of form say to the blessed one
venerable lord the śrāvaka elder su­bhūti be the emulator of the blessed one
if one be to ask why venerable lord it be because whatever the eld su­bhūti be teach he demonstrate that all thing be endow with emptiness and that they be connect to emptiness
then senior su­bhūti address the god as follow
o god when you say that the śrāvaka elder su­bhūti be the emulator of the blessed one
yet the real nature of the tathā­gata be without real nature in which case too the elder su­bhūti be the emulator of the tathā­gata
that which be the real nature of the tathā­gata be also the real nature of the elder su­bhūti
the real nature of the tathā­gata be not the past it be not the future and it be not the present
the real nature of the present be the real nature of the tathā­gata
similarly the real nature of the fruit of enter the stream and the real nature of the tathā­gata
and in the same vein the real nature of the other attainment up to and include omniscience
then senior su­bhūti pick up the thread of this conversation address the god as follow
o god the eld su­bhūti do not emulate physical form he do not emulate the real nature of physical form
and say it be wonderful that this eld su­bhūti be an emulator of the tathā­gata be endow with the real nature of the tathā­gata
thereupon senior śāradvatī­putra say to the blessed one
venerable lord this real nature of all thing the unmistaken real nature the abide nature of all thing the maturity of all thing be profound
therein physical form omniscience and the real nature be non apprehensible
the blessed one reply śāradvatī­putra it be so
it be just as you have say this real nature of all thing the unmistaken real nature the abide nature of all thing the maturity of all thing be profound
in the same vein other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
how could one possibly apprehend the real nature of consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate
while this exegesis on the real nature be be deliver the mind of twelve thousand fully ordain monk be liberate from contaminant without far grasp that would lead to subsequent rebirth
five hundred fully ordain nun cultivate the eye of the sacred doctrine unsullied and untainted with respect to all thing
five thousand god and human accept that phenomenon be non arising
the mind of sixty great-bodhisattva-being be also liberate from contaminant without far grasp that would lead to subsequent rebirth
then the blessed one address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra these great-bodhisattva-being have venerate five hundred buddha
and they have make offering to all the tathāgata
they have become renunciant maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertaken perseverance and achieve meditative concentration
and similarly this be the giver and this be the recipient gift should be offer to this recipient
and the real nature of omniscience and the rest be non apprehensible
likewise this be ethical discipline
i possess such ethical discipline
i should maintain such ethical discipline
likewise this be tolerance
i possess such tolerance
i should cultivate such tolerance
likewise this be perseverance
i possess such perseverance
i should undertake such perseverance
likewise these be the meditative concentration
i possess such meditative concentration
furthermore śāradvatī­putra although the path of enlightenment follow by those great-bodhisattva-being do possess the three gateway to liberation emptiness
signlessness and aspirationlessness they be still not favor by wisdom and by skill in mean for which reason
after they have actualize the finality of existence they will become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddha
but have merely enter the stream and similarly attain the other fruit up to and include arhatship
maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance and become equipoise in meditative concentration
without be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and without be favor by skill in mean these bodhisattva give gift
in consequence of which they actualize the finality of existence and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
śāradvatī­putra in this regard there be some person whose mind be without omniscience
who have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
again śāradvatī­putra there be great-bodhisattva-being whose mind be not without omniscience
who have be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and who be not without skill in mean
and who consequently have actualize great compassion
and who when cultivate the nature of thing that be emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
for example śāradvatī­putra suppose there be a wingless bird with a body one hundred fathom or three hundred fathom in size dwell amidst the god of the trāyastriṃśa realm
which consider migrate from there to this jambu­dvīpa
think i should dwell in jambu­dvīpa
no venerable lord the blessed one reply
again śāradvatī­putra suppose this wingless bird while descend from there be to think
no venerable lord it would descend to jambu­dvīpa absolutely wound and injure and die or experience mortal suffering
if one be to ask why venerable lord it be because this be just what would happen to any bird whatsoever with a large body and no wing fall from on high
the blessed one reply it be so śāradvatī­putra it be just as you have say
then cultivate the nature of thing that be emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness while lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and lack skill in mean
they will actualize the finality of existence and then descend to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
they will descend to the level of the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
moreover śāradvatī­putra when person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas consider conceptualize and grasp the meditative stability of the lord buddhas of the past future and present
similarly they will not understand even a fraction of the liberation of the tathāgata or of their liberating pristine cognition
those person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas make such dedication will settle into the level of the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
if you ask why śāradvatī­putra it be because those who have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and be without skill in mean will incur this very outcome
śāradvatī­putra those who with a mind free from conceptualization dispense generosity
maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance become equipoise in meditative concentration
even though they may have become equipoise in meditative concentration they have not conceptualize it even though they may have cultivate wisdom they have not conceptualize it
one should know that they be approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
similarly they have not conceptualize the ethical discipline which they have maintain
this be the case it be for these reason that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will undoubtedly attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
this be the case venerable lord
in the same vein as before
they should engage with all the other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
then the god inhabit the world system of desire and the god inhabit the world system of form say to the blessed one
venerable lord unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be hard to manifest
the blessed one reply o god it be so
it be just as you have say
unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be hard to manifest
o god i have indeed attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all thing and in all way
if you ask why it be because all thing be utterly pure on account of the emptiness of condition phenomenon and the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
as i understand and ponder the meaning of the word speak by the lord
and similarly maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance become equipoise in meditative concentration cultivate wisdom
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of their own essential nature
the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment of great-bodhisattva-being be easy to bring forth and it be easy to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti it be for this very reason that the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment of the bodhisattvas be extremely hard to bring forth
and it be extremely hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment
just as space do not entertain the thought i must attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
in the same way senior su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being also do not entertain the thought i should attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why senior su­bhūti it be because all thing be equal to space
senior su­bhūti if once great-bodhisattva-being accept that all thing resemble space
it be easy for they to bring forth unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and it be easy to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment
and it be not hard to bring this forth
and not hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment
then great-bodhisattva-being numerous as the sand of the river ganges who don the armor would not regress from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
for this reason senior su­bhūti it be clear that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be extremely hard to bring forth and it be hard to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment
this complete the twenty third chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle non acceptance and non rejection
they should praise and rejoice in other who abstain from the killing of living creature
in the same vein as before
they should praise abstention from wrong view and
they should praise and rejoice in other who abstain from wrong view
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should maintain these doctrine and do so without apprehend anything
similarly they themselves should become equipoise in the first meditative concentration
and they should become equipoise in the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration
they should also encourage other to acquire the meditative concentration up to and include the fourth
they should praise those who have attain the meditative concentration up to and include the fourth
they should also praise and rejoice in other who have become equipoise in the meditative concentration up to and include the fourth
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who seek to abide in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should maintain these doctrine and do so without apprehend anything
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should be equipoise in the attitude of love kindness
and then they should also praise and rejoice in other who be equipoise in the attitude of love kindness
and they should also praise and rejoice in other who be equipoise in the meditative stability and so forth associate with the attitude of compassion empathetic joy and equanimity
they themselves should be equipoise in the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite space
they should also praise and rejoice in other who be equipoise in the meditative absorption of the sense field up to and include the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
they themselves should perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
they should encourage other also to acquire the transcendent-perfection of generosity
they should praise the transcendent-perfection of generosity
they should also praise and rejoice in other who perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly as in the case of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the same go for the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should themselves cultivate the emptiness of internal phenomenon
they should also encourage other to acquire the cultivation of the emptiness of internal phenomenon
they should praise the cultivation of the emptiness of internal phenomenon
they should also praise and rejoice in other who cultivate the emptiness of internal phenomenon
and in the same vein as before the same go for all the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly they themselves should cultivate the four application of mindfulness
and they should also encourage other to acquire the cultivation of the four application of mindfulness
they should also praise the cultivation of the application of mindfulness
they should also praise and rejoice in other who cultivate the four application of mindfulness
and in the same vein they themselves should cultivate all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
they should also encourage other to acquire the cultivation of the noble eightfold path and so forth
they should also praise and rejoice in other who cultivate the noble eightfold path and so forth
similarly they themselves should be equipoise in the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
they should also encourage other to acquire the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
they should praise those meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
they should also praise and rejoice in other who be equipoise in the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
they themselves should be equipoise in the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
they should also encourage other to acquire the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
they should praise the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
they should also praise and rejoice in other who be equipoise in the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
they should also encourage other to acquire those fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they should praise those fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they should also praise and rejoice in other who perfect those fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they themselves should investigate the twelve link of dependent origination in their sequential and reverse modality
they should also praise and encourage other to investigate the twelve link of dependent origination in their sequential and reverse modality
they should also praise and rejoice in other who investigate the twelve link of dependent origination in their sequential and reverse modality
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should cultivate these sacred doctrine and do so without apprehend anything
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should themselves comprehend the noble truth of suffering
they should abandon the noble truth of the origin of suffering
they should actualize the noble truth of the cessation of suffering
they should cultivate the noble truth of the path that lead to the cessation of suffering
they should praise the four noble truth
they should also encourage other to acquire the understanding through which the fruit of enter the stream be actualize
they should praise the actualization of the fruit of enter the stream
they should praise and rejoice in other who cultivate the understanding through which the fruit of enter the stream be actualize
just as in the case of the fruit of enter the stream
this same refrain should also be apply in the case of the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth and the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth up to and include the fruit of arhatship
they themselves should also cultivate the understanding through which individual enlightenment be actualize but through which the finality of existence be not actualize
they should also encourage other to acquire the actualization of individual enlightenment
they should praise the actualization of individual enlightenment
they should praise and rejoice in other who cultivate the understanding through which individual enlightenment be actualize
they themselves should enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
they should also encourage other to acquire the maturity of the bodhisattvas
they should praise the maturity of the bodhisattvas
they should praise and rejoice in other who enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
furthermore su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should themselves bring sentient being to maturation
they should also praise and rejoice in other who act in order to bring sentient being to maturation
they themselves should refine the buddhafield
they should also praise and rejoice in other who act in order to refine the buddhafield
they themselves should attain omniscience manifestly perfect enlightenment
and they should also praise and rejoice in other who attain omniscience manifestly perfect buddhahood
they themselves should abandon involuntary reincarnation through propensity and all afflict mental state
they should encourage other to relinquish involuntary reincarnation through propensity and all afflict mental state
they should also praise the relinquishing of involuntary reincarnation through propensity and all afflict mental state
and they should also praise and rejoice in other who relinquish involuntary reincarnation through propensity and all afflict mental state
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should themselves acquire an excellent life span
they should encourage other to acquire an excellent life span
they should also praise an excellent life span
and they should also praise and rejoice in other who acquire an excellent life span
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should abide in these sacred doctrine and do so without apprehend anything
they themselves should turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
they should also praise and rejoice in other who turn or will turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who seek to attain emancipation in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should abide in these sacred doctrine and do so without apprehend anything
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should train accordingly in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they should maintain their skill in mean
the physical form of those who train in this manner and abide in this manner will be unobscured
their feeling will be unobscured their perception will be unobscured their formative predisposition will be unobscured their consciousness will be unobscured
and in the same vein they will be unobscured with regard to the sacred doctrine and so forth
and similarly they have not grasp feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly those feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness that have not be grasp be not consciousness and the rest
when he explain this status of the bodhisattvas
twelve thousand bodhisattva accept that phenomenon be non arising
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of perseverance accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
and attain final nirvāṇa through whichever of the three vehicle be appropriate
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly will swiftly perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection see those sentient being who have be bear in the hell or as animal
and those in the world under the sway of yama they should reflect alas when i have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will swiftly perfect the six transcendent-perfection and approach omniscience
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will swiftly perfect the six transcendent-perfection and approach omniscience
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will perfect the six transcendent-perfection and also approach omniscience
alas when i have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield i will practice the six transcendent-perfection by any mean until all sentient being be endow with the five extrasensory power i will even refine the buddhafield i will also bring sentient being to maturity
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will perfect the six transcendent-perfection and also approach omniscience
i will even refine the buddhafield i will also bring sentient being to maturity and so on in the same vein as before down to they will also approach omniscience
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection see finite buddhafield they should reflect
i will even refine the buddhafield i will also bring sentient being to maturity
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice six transcendent-perfection accordingly will swiftly perfect the six transcendent-perfection and also approach omniscience
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will swiftly perfect the six transcendent-perfection and also approach omniscience
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom make offering to the three precious jewel namely to the buddha the sacred doctrine and the monastic community over eon as numerous as the sand of the river ganges and also when they make donation to other sentient being
if you ask why it be because this vehicle of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being and it be through this vehicle that they pursue omniscience
and dispense generosity maintain ethical discipline practice tolerance cultivate perseverance become equipoise in meditative concentration
and cultivate wisdom they will generate many merit great than those
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the great-bodhisattva-being who act accordingly be engage in perfection
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should not lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
he reply this be owe to the non apprehension of exhalation and inhalation
alas when i have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield i will practice the six transcendent-perfection by any mean until these sentient being can no long be distinguish by their color
and then through non analytical attention dedicate their merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being
and through non analytical attention dedicate these merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being that one will generate many merit great than those
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because dedication in this context‌ denote this dedication of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti that bodhisattva should realize that there be no dedication of merit lack the dedication of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being should never lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they should be skilled in dedicate the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the precursor of all aspect of enlightenment
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being should be skilled in dedicate the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this complete the twenty fourth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle initial engagement
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom precede all dedication of merit
when anyone abide in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be reveal
and even for a single day rejoice in all these root of virtuous action and then dedicate the merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being that one will generate many merit great than those
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
how should they investigate the meditative stability of signlessness
how should they become equipoise in the meditative stability of signlessness
how should they investigate the meditative stability of aspirationlessness
how should they become equipoise in the meditative stability of aspirationlessness
how should they investigate the four application of mindfulness
how should they cultivate the four application of mindfulness
in the same vein how should they investigate the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
how should they cultivate the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
how should they investigate the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
how should they cultivate those fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should determine that physical form be empty
similarly they should determine that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty
in the same vein they should determine that the world system of desire the world system of form and the world system of formlessness be empty
by whatever mean they make such determination they should do so with an unwavering mind
when the mind be unwavering
they will discern those phenomenon exactly as they be
even if they be to consider those phenomenon they would not actualize they
and in the same vein they may not have degenerate from the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
even though in the meantime great-bodhisattva-being may not have degenerate from the attribute which be the aspect of enlightenment
even though great-bodhisattva-being may not have establish their mind in equipoise they do focus their mind on meditative object
the blessed one reply
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being be endow with such extensive attribute
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being be already establish in the attribute which be the aspect of enlightenment
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom well know that this be not the time for actualization but rather it be the time for investigation
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being should also reflect this be the time for the transcendent-perfection of generosity
this be the time for the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline this be the time for the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
this be the time for the transcendent-perfection of perseverance this be the time for the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
and this be the time for the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this be the time for cultivate the four application of mindfulness
this be the time for cultivate the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
this be the time for cultivate the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
this be the time for cultivate omniscience
however this be not the time for cultivate the fruit of enter the stream
for example su­bhūti suppose there be a heroic man
steadfast in his commitment
of fine physique
handsome
beautiful to behold
and well train in archery who have also handle sharp weapon
perfect the sixty four craft fully master all the art
cultivate the eighteen great field of knowledge
and who be outstanding joyful and crowd pleasing
he would acquire great reward through whatever task he have to undertake since he would have train well in all field
even if enemy murderer and a band of assailant be to harass they in that wilderness
he be endow with the supreme power of discernment
but he would not wish to attack those sentient being nor would he be agitate
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because a man such as this would have be proficiently train in archery and besides that in all other useful skill
after perfect the six transcendent-perfection they will not achieve the cessation of contaminant but they will absolutely investigate omniscience
and even though they be establish in emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness they will not be sway or captivate by they
indeed they will not actualize those gateway to liberation which by mean of actualization would cause they to regress to the level of the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should make a definitive analysis in accord with the reality of these phenomenon
but when those root of virtuous action have be bring to maturity in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment then they do actualize the authentic finality of existence
similarly su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
that be retain by skill in mean do not actualize the finality of existence until the root of virtuous action have be bring to maturity in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
for example su­bhūti when a powerful man train in archery fire an arrow far into the sky
the arrow would all fall to the ground in succession one after the other
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
this be most amazing
and similarly they actualize signlessness as a gateway to liberation and aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation
so it be that great-bodhisattva-being for the sake of those sentient being then actualize emptiness as a gateway to liberation
the blessed one reply
o god this be the real nature of all thing through which great-bodhisattva-being after attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with regard to the real nature acquire the title tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
homage to all the buddha and bodhisattvas
when the eastern side be ascendant the western side be low
when the western side be ascendant the eastern side be low
thus have i hear on a certain occasion
the blessed one be reside at vulture peak near rāja­gṛha with a large monastic gathering comprise many thousand of fully ordain monk
all of they be arhat who have attain the cessation of contaminant and be without afflict mental state
when the southern side be ascendant the northern side be low
when the northern side be ascendant the southern side be low
when the northern side be ascendant the southern side be low
when their extreme be ascendant their center be low
and when the center be ascendant the extreme be low
fully control their mind thoroughly liberate
their wisdom well liberated
thoroughbred
mighty nāga
their task accomplish
their work complete
their burden relinquish
their own objective already fulfil
the fetter bind they to the rebirth process completely sever
their mind thoroughly liberate by mean of genuine understanding
with the exception of one person
senior ānanda a disciple who have merely enter the stream
also present be some five hundred fully ordain nun layman and laywoman all of whom have see the truth
also present be some five hundred fully ordain nun layman and laywoman all of whom have see the truth
there be many thousand of great-bodhisattva-being all of whom have master the mnemonic retention
he do not emulate anything other than the real nature of omniscience
he do not emulate anything other than omniscience
and attain the meditative stability
he do not emulate the real nature of omniscience
and be abide in emptiness
they themselves should also cultivate the understanding through which the fruit of enter the stream be actualize but through which the finality of existence be not actualize
he do not emulate unconditioned phenomenon
extensively accumulate their aspiration over countless eon
nor do he emulate the real nature of unconditioned phenomenon
he do not emulate anything other than unconditioned phenomenon
he do not emulate anything other than unconditioned phenomenon
they have accumulate merit by teach the sacred doctrine
he do not emulate anything other than the real nature of unconditioned phenomenon
liberated from all obscuration associate with past action
therein physical form and the real nature of physical form be non apprehensible
they have acquire assurance and completely go beyond demonic activity
therein feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and the real nature of consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate be non apprehensible
they have perfect their acceptance of the profound nature of phenomenon
in the same vein when even other attribute and attainment themselves up to and include omniscience be non apprehensible
in the same vein when even other attribute and attainment themselves up to and include omniscience be non apprehensible
they could teach the sacred doctrine free from worldliness
they have not attain the non differentiation of perception which work toward the maturity of the bodhisattvas
they have not enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of tolerance accordingly they will swiftly perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
their ethical conduct be without artificiality and they have no thought of ulterior profit acquisition or fame
as well as their wisdom ethical discipline liberation
and their perception of liberate pristine cognition even though they meditate they will not understand even a fraction of the ethical discipline of the tathāgata
they be all bodhisattva who know how to actualize one hundred thousand emanational display by mean of their meditative stability among they be the follow
along with ratnā­kara
also while they lack understanding and perception they will hear talk about the path of enlightenment regard the nature of thing that be emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
they will not conceptualize the meditative stability of emptiness
they will not conceptualize the meditative stability of signlessness or the meditative stability of aspirationlessness
even though they may have maintain ethical discipline they have not conceptualize it
even though they may have cultivate tolerance they have not conceptualize it
even though they may have undertake perseverance they have not conceptualize it
avalokiteśvara
mañjuśrī
ratna­mudrā­hasta
the bodhisattva nityokṣipta­hasta
and distinct from they they acquire a golden hue beautiful to behold with a fine and splendid physique and the fine of complexion i will even refine the buddhafield i will also bring sentient being to maturity
and the great bodhisattva be maitreya
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will perfect the six transcendent-perfection and also approach omniscience
anikṣiptadhura
also from all the pore of his body an effulgence of light ray shine forth many hundred of billion trillion in number
venerable lord with regard to that which be call the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the five power
so it be that senior śāradvatī­putra listen to the blessed one and
venerable lord so be it he reply
to that end you should listen carefully keep my word in mind and
i shall teach the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
thereupon the blessed one inspire senior śāradvatī­putra with the word excellent
will also swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
this sacred doctrine be compatible with omniscience
nowhere be this sacred doctrine obstruct
if you ask how it be unobstructed it be unobstructed with regard to physical form
then if you ask what be the six outer sense field
they comprise   the sense field of sight   the sense field of sound   the sense field of odor   the sense field of taste   the sense field of tangible and   the sense field of mental phenomenon
these be call the six outer sense field
these be call the six inner sense field
since the real nature arise from nowhere
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection accordingly will perfect the six transcendent-perfection and also approach omniscience
and depart for nowhere so the real nature of the elder su­bhūti also arise from nowhere and
depart for nowhere in which case the elder su­bhūti be indeed the emulator of the tathā­gata
in the same vein venerable lord
conversely through the cessation of fundamental ignorance formative predisposition cease
mental discomfort and agitation all cease
they can not cultivate the noble eightfold path
similarly all of these can not cultivate the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power and the branch of enlightenment
and through the cessation of aging and death sorrow lamentation suffering
they can not cultivate the attainment up to and include omniscience
these two process be respectively say to follow and reverse the sequence in which the twelve link of dependent origination arise
if you ask what be the four application of mindfulness
the sensory element of auditory consciousness
the sensory element of the nose
the sensory element of odor
and   the application of mindfulness which with regard to phenomenon observe phenomena
the sensory element of olfactory consciousness
the sensory element of the tongue
the sensory element of taste
the sensory element of gustatory consciousness
the sensory element of the body
the sensory element of tangible
the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon
the emptiness of condition phenomenon
the emptiness of ultimate reality
the emptiness of great extent
craving which arise contingent on sensation
the emptiness of emptiness
grasping which arise contingent on craving
the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon
the emptiness of external phenomenon
the rebirth process which arise contingent on grasp
actual birth which arise contingent on the rebirth process
and   age and death along with sorrow lamentation suffering mental discomfort and agitation which all arise contingent on actual birth
they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attribute which have not yet arise might be develop and
the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
the power of meditative stability
o god those person who practice in order that they might grasp or reject physical form
and similarly who practice in order that they might grasp or reject feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness can not cultivate the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they can not cultivate the transcendent-perfection of generosity and similarly they can not cultivate the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
correct recollection and
correct meditative stability
if you ask what be aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation
if you ask what be signlessness as a gateway to liberation
while equanimity and mindfulness be utterly pure
if you ask what be the four immeasurable aspiration
o the blessed one have reveal this sacred doctrine which be incompatible with mundane thing
the sense field of infinite consciousness have be completely transcend in all respect
the third aspect of liberation ensue when being be incline toward pleasant state
o god this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomenon and the sensory element of mental consciousness
if you ask what constitute the eight aspect of liberation they be as follow
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the infinite transcendent-perfection
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection be void
the seventh meditative absorption ensue when the sense field of infinite consciousness have be completely transcend in all respect and one achieve and abide in the sense field of nothing at all think there be nothing at all
the sixth meditative absorption ensue when the sense field of infinite space have be completely transcend in all respect and when one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite consciousness think consciousness be infinite
the fifth meditative absorption ensue when the perception of physical form have be completely transcend in all respect when the perception of obstruct material phenomenon have subside and the mind do not engage with diverse perception so that one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite space think space be infinite
the fourth meditative absorption ensue when one achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration that be to say when even that sense of bliss be abandon and former state of suffering have also be eliminate here neither suffering nor bliss be present because blissful and unhappy state of mind have both subside while equanimity and mindfulness be utterly pure

their tolerance endow with equanimity
their inspiration unimpede
indeed they all have the five extrasensory power and captivate speech
and the mind do not engage with diverse perception

among they the eye be empty of the eye because they do not endure and they do not disintegrate
among they internal phenomenon be empty of internal phenomenon because they do not endure and they do not disintegrate
external phenomenon be also empty of external phenomenon because they do not endure and they do not disintegrate
that emptiness which be the emptiness of all phenomenon be also empty of the emptiness of all phenomenon because it do not endure and do not disintegrate
in this regard nirvāṇa be empty of nirvāṇa because it do not endure and do not disintegrate
this refer to the world system of desire the world system of form and the world system of formlessness
among which the world system of desire be empty of the world system of desire and similarly the world system of form be empty of the world system of form and the world system of formlessness be empty of the world system of formlessness because they do not endure and do not disintegrate
if you ask why it be because it be their very nature that be call the emptiness of condition phenomenon
in this regard unconditioned phenomenon be empty of unconditioned phenomena because they do not endure and do not disintegrate
if you ask why it be because it be their very nature
that be call the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena
that be call the emptiness of the unlimited
that be call the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
that be call the emptiness of non dispersal
that be call the emptiness of inherent existence
if you ask what be the emptiness of all intrinsic define characteristic
this denote the intrinsic define characteristic of physical form which be the capacity to assume physical form
the intrinsic define characteristic of feeling which be emotional experience
the intrinsic define characteristic of perception which be comprehensibility
the intrinsic define characteristic of formative predisposition which be conditioning
and the intrinsic define characteristic of consciousness which be cognizance
it apply to the define characteristic of condition phenomenon such as these and similarly extend as far as the define characteristic of unconditioned phenomenon
all these intrinsic define characteristic be empty of their own intrinsic define characteristic because they do not endure and do not disintegrate
if you ask why it be because it be their very nature
that be call the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
if you ask what be the emptiness of all thing
the term all thing denote the five psycho physical aggregate the twelve sense field the eighteen sensory element corporeal phenomenon formless phenomenon condition phenomenon and unconditioned phenomenon
all such thing be empty of all thing because they do not endure and do not disintegrate
that be call the emptiness of all thing
if you ask why it be because that be its very nature
that be call the emptiness of non apprehension
this be call the emptiness of non entity
if you ask what be the emptiness of essential nature it be the absence of any essential nature with respect to anything originate from combination of cause and condition
that be call the emptiness of essential nature
if you ask what be the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity it too be the absence of any essential nature in anything originate from combination of cause and condition
that be call the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
moreover śāradvatī­putra entity be empty of entity
non entity be empty of non entity essential nature be empty of essential nature extraneous entity be empty of extraneous entity
if you ask what be entity the term entities denote the five psycho physical aggregate which comprise physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in this regard entity be empty of entity
if you ask in what way non entity be empty of non entity the term non entity denote unconditione phenomenon
in this regard unconditioned phenomenon be empty of unconditioned phenomenon
similarly non entity be empty of non entity
if you ask in what way the essential nature be empty of the essential nature the essential nature of all phenomenon be not create by be know it be not create by be see and it be not create by anything at all
in this way the essential nature be say to be empty of the essential nature
if you ask in what way extraneous entity be empty of extraneous entity
whether the tathāgata have appear or whether the tathāgata have not appear the abide nature of all thing the expanse of reality the maturity with respect to all thing the real nature the incontrovertible real nature the inalienable real nature and the finality of existence all of these continue to abide
anything that be empty of phenomenon extraneous to these attribute may be call an extraneous entity that be empty of extraneous entity
śāradvatī­putra these be all attribute with respect to which a great-bodhisattva-being should cultivate detachment
one who be without fixation will reach the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
this complete the first chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle the context
then once again the blessed one address senior śāradvatī­putra in the follow word
śāradvatī­putra if you ask what be the ten power of the tathāgata they be as follow
definitive knowledge that thing which be impossible be indeed impossible
definitive knowledge through possibility and cause of the maturation of past future and present action and of those who undertake such action
definitive knowledge of multiple world system and diverse disposition
definitive knowledge of the diversity of inclination and the multiplicity of inclination that other sentient being and other individual have
definitive knowledge of whether the acuman of other sentient being and other individual be supreme or not
definitive knowledge of the path that lead anywhere
definitive knowledge of all the afflict and purify mental state and their emergence with respect to the faculty power branch of enlightenment aspect of liberation meditative concentration meditative stability and formless absorption
definitive knowledge of the recollection of multiple past abode and of the transference of consciousness at the death and birth of all sentient being
when i claim to have attain genuinely perfect buddhahood if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else should say that i have not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to these particular phenomenon here i would correctly disregard that reason for contradict i base on their worldly doctrine
śāradvatī­putra these be call the ten power of the tathāgata
śāradvatī­putra if you ask what be the four assurance proclaim by the tathāgata they be as follow
i claim my exalt place as a great leader
i will rightly roar the lion ’s roar in the midst of the assembly
i will turn the wheel of brahmā which have not previously be turn in the world in conformity with the sacred doctrine by any virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else
when i claim i be one whose contaminant have cease if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else should say that these particular contaminant of mine have not cease i would correctly disregard that reason for contradict i base on their worldly doctrine

it be as if someone be to see the corp of elephant cavalry chariot and infantry without becoming fixate on the notion this be an army
śāradvatī­putra in the same way great-bodhisattva-being perceive all phenomenon distinctly but do not become fixate on they
śāradvatī­putra just as when someone afflict by intense heat perceive various mirage like image move in the manner of wave but do not become fixate on the notion that this mirage be actually water

just as when someone see the reflection of their face in a mirror but do not become fixate on the notion that it be actually their face
śāradvatī­putra it be in this manner that great-bodhisattva-being perceive all thing distinctly but do not become fixate on those phenomenon
one who be without fixation on anything will reach the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
this complete the second chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle all phenomena
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one venerable lord what be the fixation of a bodhisattva
śāradvatī­putra fixation denote the view that bodhisattva might adopt with regard to all thing and the deluded mindset which they might have
then he ask lord what what view might great-bodhisattva-being adopt with respect to all thing
śāradvatī­putra there be view which concern the psycho physical aggregate the sensory element the sense field the noble truth and dependent origination
similarly there be view concern the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and liberation
similarly there be view concern the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
similarly there be a view concern the contemplation of impurity a view concern the recollection a view concern the aspect of perception a view concern the mode of knowledge a view concern the meditative stability a view concern the faculty a view concern the sense field of mastery and a view concern the aspect of emptiness
similarly there be view concern the ten power of a tathāgata the assurance the unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha the understanding of all phenomenon the understanding of the aspect of the path and omniscience
similarly there be a view concern the transcendent-perfection a view concern the extrasensory power a view concern the eye a view concern the major mark and a view concern the minor mark
śāradvatī­putra these be the view that great-bodhisattva-being might adopt with respect to all thing
then he ask lord what be the delude mindset that great-bodhisattva-being might have with respect to all thing
śāradvatī­putra with regard to those phenomenon that commence from the five psycho physical aggregate and extend as far as the link of dependent origination know as age and death
and likewise with regard to those commence from the four application of mindfulness and extend as far as the noble eightfold path
and likewise with regard to those commence from the three gateway to liberation and extend as far as the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
and likewise with regard to those commence from the ten power of the tathāgata and extend as far as omniscience
and likewise with regard to those commence from the six transcendent-perfection and extend as far as the eighty minor mark
when one view they as permanent or impermanent as conducive to happiness or suffering as a self or not a self
empty or not empty with sign or signless have aspiration or without aspiration
calm or not calm void or not void afflict or purify arise or not arise ceasing or not ceasing and as entity or non entity
and when one apprehend define and engage in ideation and scrutiny with respect to they
that be call the deluded mind which great-bodhisattva-being might have with respect to all thing
moreover śāradvatī­putra whenever a great-bodhisattva-being hold the view that these be virtuous phenomenon these be non virtuous phenomenon
these be specific phenomenon these be non specific phenomena
these be mundane phenomenon these be supramundane phenomenon
these be contaminate phenomenon these be uncontaminated phenomenon
these be condition phenomenon these be unconditioned phenomenon
these be common phenomenon or these be uncommon phenomena
and then apprehend define and engage in ideation and scrutiny with respect to they
if you ask why it be because there be no sentient being because sentient being be non apprehensible because sentient being be non arising because sentient being be uncease and because sentient being be in fact emptiness
the same go for living organism live living creature individual humankind human being actor creator petitioner instigator experiencer experience subject and knower
because they be not perceive because they be non apprehensible because they be non arising because they be uncease and because they be in fact emptiness
indeed all phenomenon be non arising unceasing empty unmoving vacuous without a self non originated uncreated unconditioned and without creator or actor
if you ask why it be the case that these physical form be merely name and the same also go for feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
indeed the same apply to all the remain phenomenological category as far as the dependent link of aging and death
similarly these four application of mindfulness be merely name and the same apply to all the remain causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
these three gateway to liberation be merely name and the same apply to all the remain meditative experience up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
these ten power of the tathāgata be merely name and the same apply to all the remain fruitional attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
these six transcendent-perfection be merely name and the same apply to all the remain fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark
śāradvatī­putra with regard to those thing which be merely name be there any that be absolutely existent
there be none lord he reply
śāradvatī­putra say the blessed one
if one be to view these as absolutely existent and apprehend they dualistically define they and engage in ideation and scrutiny with respect to they do you think that this would not be tantamount to the aforementione view that bodhisattva might adopt and to the delude mind which they might have
śāradvatī­putra for these reason you should understand that the view bodhisattva might adopt and the deluded mind which they might have be both designate as fixation

venerable lord if all phenomenon be merely conceptualize and merely nominal
would it not follow venerable lord that all thing have an essential nature of non entity

whatever your reasoning one be not liberate by perceive physical form and all the other aggregate up to and include consciousness as entity
nor be one liberate by perceive they as non entity and nor be one liberate by perceive they as entity and non entity
likewise this apply to the eye and in the same vein to all the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
likewise it apply to sight and in the same vein to all the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon
likewise it apply to the sensory element of the eye and in the same vein to all the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness

in all these case one be not liberate by perceive they as entity nor be one liberate by perceive they as non entity and nor be one liberate by perceive they as entity and non entity
in the same vein this should be extend to cover the entire range of phenomenon just as have be present here with reference to the aggregate of physical form and so forth
thereupon senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord if therefore physical form do not exist and they be not apprehensible
how could one be liberate by perceive physical form as entity or by perceive they as non entity or by perceive they as both entity and non entity
the same go for feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
likewise the same go for the eye and in the same vein the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
likewise the same go for sight and in the same vein the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon
likewise the same go for the noble truth and in the same vein all other phenomenon up to and include the dependent link of aging and death
likewise the same go for the application of mindfulness and in the same vein all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
likewise the same go for the gateway to liberation and in the same vein all the other attainment up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
likewise the same go for the power of the tathāgata and in the same vein all the other fruitional attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
likewise the same go for the six transcendent-perfection and in the same vein all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark
if these do not exist and be not apprehensible how could one be liberate by perceive they as entity or by perceive they as non entity or by perceive they as both entity and non entity
if one be to ask why venerable lord it be because afflict mental state would be indicate
if one be to ask what those indication would be the indication of those afflict mental state would comprise sight sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
venerable lord whatever be subject to afflict mental state be not liberate
the blessed one then reply śāradvatī­putra well do well do you have speak well

śāradvatī­putra emptiness neither arise nor cease
it be neither afflict nor purified
it neither decrease nor increase
it be neither past future nor present

śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly be say to engage in union
when they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the transcendent-perfection of generosity with the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline with the transcendent-perfection of tolerance with the transcendent-perfection of perseverance or with the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
similarly they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the application of mindfulness
in the same vein they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the noble eightfold path or with all the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the ten power of the tathāgata
in the same vein they do not consider whether or not they engage in union with the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha or with all other attainment up to and include omniscience
śāradvatī­putra it be for these reason that great-bodhisattva-being who engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be say to engage in union
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be approach omniscience
commensurate with their approach to omniscience they attain complete purity of the body complete purity of speech complete purity of mind and complete purity of define mark
commensurate with their attainment of complete purity of the body complete purity of speech complete purity of mind and complete purity of define mark they do not entertain thought of desire
and similarly they do not entertain thought of hatred and delusion
they do not entertain thought of pride pretentiousness deceit attachment miserliness envy or all sort of mistaken view
since they do not entertain thought of desire
and similarly they do not entertain any other such thought up to and include the plethora of mistaken view they be never conceive within a mother ’s womb and they will invariably be bear miraculously
except in order to bring sentient being to maturation they will never be bear in the inferior realm
they will proceed from one field to another field
they will bring sentient being to maturation they will completely refine the field
and they will never be separate from the lord buddhas until they attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
consequently śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who wish to attain these enlighten attribute and advantage
should engage in union in that manner at all time without abandon their engagement with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why śāradvatī­putra it be because this union of great-bodhisattva-being this union of emptiness be supreme
śāradvatī­putra this union whereby great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom endure when all other engagement have be surpass
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who maintain this union achieve the ten power of the tathāgata
they achieve the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who maintain this union never entertain thought of miserliness
they never entertain thought of degenerate morality thought of agitation thought of indolence thought of distraction or thought of stupidity
then senior śāradvatī­putra senior mahā­maudgalyāyana senior su­bhūti senior mahākāśyapa senior pūrṇa­maitrāyaṇī­putra
and in addition to they a multitude of renowned fully ordain monk
as well as assembly of great-bodhisattva-being layman and laywoman all address the blessed one as follow
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection of great-bodhisattva-being be great
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection of great-bodhisattva-being be supreme among the vast transcendent-perfection
it be the particularly sublime transcendent-perfection it be the most excellent transcendent-perfection
it be the unsurpassed transcendent-perfection it be the high transcendent-perfection
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be equal to the unequaled transcendent-perfection of great-bodhisattva-being
transcendent-perfection be calm and peaceful transcendent-perfection be empty of its own define characteristic
transcendent-perfection be the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity transcendent-perfection be extensive in all enlighten attribute
transcendent-perfection be endow with all enlighten attribute transcendent-perfection be a state of uncrushability
venerable lord those who be supreme among great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they bestow generosity that be equal to the unequaled they perfect generosity that be equal to the unequaled
they perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity that be equal to the unequaled
they obtain a physical form that be equal to the unequaled and they attain attribute that be equal to the unequaled whereby they attain the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
in the same vein just as it have be state here in relation to the transcendent-perfection of generosity
so it be with the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord you o lord also acquire the sacred doctrine that be equal to the unequaled though practice this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
likewise you acquire physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness that be equal to the unequaled
likewise you turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine that be equal to the unequaled
the lord buddha of the past also acquire their sacred doctrine that be equal to the unequaled after practice this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and they turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine that be equal to the unequaled
likewise the lord buddhas of the future also will acquire their sacred doctrine that be equal to the unequaled after practice this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and in the same vein they will turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine that be equal to the unequaled
venerable lord since this be the case great-bodhisattva-being who seek to transcend all phenomenon should continue to engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the blessed one then address those great śrāvaka and those great-bodhisattva-being as follow
o wise one o child of enlighten heritage it be so it be so
o wise one o child of enlighten heritage it be just as you have say
o wise one o child of enlighten heritage those great-bodhisattva-being who continue to engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
deserve the respect of the entire world with its god human and antigod
this complete the fourth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle union
having perfect the high of all mental faculty
observe those miraculous form emanate through the miraculous ability of the tathā­gata
swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
śāradvatī­putra that which be call the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the absence of fixation with respect to all thing
śāradvatī­putra bodhisattva who be without fixation
perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and will indeed swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
then he ask
they comprise   the sense field of the eye   the sense field of the ear   the sense field of the nose   the sense field of the tongue   the sense field of the body and   the sense field of the mental faculty
fundamental ignorance contingent on which   formative predisposition arise
the application of mindfulness which with regard to the physical body observe the physical body
they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attribute which have previously arise might remain be unforgotten flourish and reach complete perfection in the future through cultivation
the support for miraculous ability combine the meditative stability of resolution with the formative force of exertion
the support for miraculous ability combine the meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertion
the faculty of faith
the power of faith
the branch of enlightenment that entail correct recollection
correct view
the state of mind which discern that all thing be empty of their own define characteristic
the state of mind which discern in all respect that all thing be signless in term of their own define characteristic
the state of mind in which all thing be not form and there be nothing to be form
bodhisattvas achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration where there be freedom from desire and freedom from negative and non virtuous attribute while ideation and scrutiny be present alongside the joy and bliss that arise from freedom
they achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration where there be an intense inner clarity free from both ideation and scrutiny the absence of ideation and scrutiny be due to one point mental focus while the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability be present
they achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration where joy be absent abide in equanimity due to the absence of attachment to joy while both mindfulness and alertness be present and bliss be experience by the body this be what sublime being describe as mindful blissful abide in bliss and equanimous
they achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration where even that sense of bliss be abandon and former state of suffering have also be eliminate here neither suffering nor bliss be present because blissful and unhappy state of mind have both subside while equanimity and mindfulness be utterly pure
these be call the four meditative concentration
they comprise   love kindness   compassion   empathetic joy and   equanimity
they comprise   the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite space   the meditative absorption of the sense field of infinite consciousness   the meditative absorption of the sense field of nothing at all and   the meditative absorption of neither perception nor non perception
the fourth aspect of liberation ensue when the perception of physical form have be completely transcend in all respect when the perception of obstruct phenomenon have subside and the mind do not engage with diverse perception so that one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite space think space be infinite
contemplation of a bloated corpse
recollection of the buddha
recollection of respiration
recollection of physicality and
perception of impermanence
it be the understanding that the eye be impermanent and
likewise it be the understanding that the ear nose tongue body mental faculty sight sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon be all impermanent
the fourth sense field of mastery refer to the miraculous perceptual transformation that ensue when one who perceive inner formlessness regard yellow external form yellow color yellow appearance and yellow reflection such as the yellow form yellow color yellow appearance and yellow reflection of the cassia flower or excellent yellow cloth from vārāṇasī in the same way one who perceive inner formlessness regard yellow external form yellow color yellow appearance and yellow reflection and understand these form having attain mastery over they and see they having attain mastery over they
the seventh sense field of mastery ensue when the perception of physical form have be completely transcend in all respect when the perception of obstruct material phenomenon have subside and the mind do not engage with diverse perception so that one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite space think space be infinite
the third sense field of mastery refer to the miraculous perceptual transformation that ensue when one who perceive inner formlessness regard blue external form blue color blue appearance and blue reflection such as the blue form the blue color the blue appearance and the blue reflection of the flax blossom or excellent blue cloth from vārāṇasī in the same way one who perceive inner formlessness regard blue external form blue color blue appearance and blue reflection and understand these form having attain mastery over they and see they having attain mastery over they
so that one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite space think space be infinite
and when one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite consciousness think consciousness be infinite
the seventh sense field of mastery ensue when
the eighth sense field of mastery ensue when
the total consummation of the earth element
consider all element to be present in the fire element
all of they be transform into a single element which be exclusively the earth element
all of they be transform into a single element which be exclusively the water element
all of they be transform into a single element which be exclusively the fire element
all of they be transform into a single element which be exclusively the wind element
all of they be then transform into a single element which be exclusively the space element
it be because they intensify the production of their respective element to the point of consummation that they be call sense field of total consummation
these be call the sense field of total consummation
emptiness of external phenomenon
emptiness of internal phenomenon
emptiness of all thing
emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
among they sight be empty of sight because they do not endure and they do not disintegrate
the southern western northern and four intermediate direction all eight be also
if you ask what be the emptiness of ultimate reality
the term ultimate reality denote nirvāṇa in the context of the emptiness of ultimate reality
f you ask what be the emptiness of unconditioned phenomena
the term unconditioned phenomenon denote anything that do not arise that do not abide that do not disintegrate and that do not change into something else
if you ask what be the emptiness of the unlimited
the arise of anything which have no limit be utterly non apprehensible because it do not endure and do not disintegrate
if you ask what be the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
the coming to pass of anything in cyclic existence that have no beginning or end be utterly non apprehensible because it do not endure and do not disintegrate
if you ask what be the emptiness of non dispersal
this denote anything in which there be no dispersion thing be empty of non dispersal because they do not endure and do not disintegrate
if you ask what be the emptiness of inherent existence
this denote the true nature of all condition and unconditioned phenomenon which be not create by the śrāvaka not create by the pratyekabuddha and not fashion by the lord buddhas inherent existence be empty of inherent existence because it do not endure and do not disintegrate if you ask why it be because that be its very nature
if you ask what be the emptiness of non entity
it be the non apprehension of any entity in anything whatsoever
if you ask what be the emptiness of non apprehension
it be that which do not apprehend any phenomenon at all non apprehension be empty of non apprehension because it do not endure and do not disintegrate
definitive knowledge that thing which be possible be indeed possible
through one ’s own extrasensory power one have actualize achieve and maintain in this very lifetime the liberation of mind and the liberation of wisdom in the state that be free from contaminant because all contaminant have cease and
so one can say my rebirth have come to an end i have practice chastity i have fulfil my duty i will experience no other rebirth apart from this one
by correctly disregard that reason i have find happiness and abide therein
can not be appropriate on account of
it be because indication be afflictive
what one might ask constitute those indication
indication include sight
ndication include sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
in the same vein
the gateway of mnemonic incantation be indication
other meditative experience up to and include the gateway of meditative stability be indication
these be call indication
they be also afflictive and they should not be acquire
they should not be experience
otherwise the wander mendicant śreṇika also would not have gain faith in this omniscient pristine cognition
what you may ask be faith
it imply conviction ideation volition reliance attention appraisal and scrutiny all without any kind of sign or indication
therefore indication should not be acquire
the wandering mendicant śreṇika indeed become a follower of the great vehicle endow with faith owe to the power of his volition and he subsequently enter into it by understand the emptiness of inherent existence
he do not appropriate physical form nor do he appropriate feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness in the manner of indication
it be because the appropriation of all thing which be empty of their own define characteristic do not arise
it be because he do not consider that understanding to be due to the attainment of clear realization of internal phenomenon
it be because he do not consider anything which could engender that understanding any understanding that could be engender or anything from which that understanding could be engender
he do not consider that understanding to be anything other than physical form
he do not consider it to be anything other than feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
inasmuch as all thing can not be appropriate he do not apprehend anything that he might have grasp or anything that he might have relinquish
venerable lord owe to the non appropriation of all thing bodhisattvas do not grasp physical form and similarly they do not grasp feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
owe to the non appropriation of all thing they do not grasp all the gateway of mnemonic incantation and other meditative attribute up to and include the gateway of meditative stability
owe to the non existence of transmigration from one world to another at the time of death
they do not make assumption even on account of this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
without having perfect the causal attribute from the four application of mindfulness up to the noble eightfold path and the fruitional attribute from the ten power of the tathāgata up to the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha they will not pass into final nirvāṇa prematurely
it be because they consider that those application of mindfulness be not application of mindfulness
because they consider that all the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be not the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and the rest
characterize by the non appropriation of physical form possess by great-bodhisattva-being and similarly the non appropriation of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and so on
up to the non appropriation of the gateway of mnemonic incantation and the gateway of meditative stability
from the non appropriation of the application of mindfulness up to the noble eightfold path and in the same vein from the ten power of the tathāgata up to the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
moreover venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should investigate
what be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
whereby be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
whose be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and for what purpose be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they should determine that the non existence and non apprehension of anything at all denote the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti what be the thing that do not exist and that be non apprehensible
it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon owe to the emptiness of external phenomenon
owe to the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon
owe to the emptiness of emptiness
owe to the emptiness of great extent
owe to the emptiness of ultimate reality
owe to the emptiness of condition phenomenon
owe to the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon
owe to the emptiness of the unlimited
owe to the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
owe to the emptiness of that which be not be to abandon
owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
owe to the emptiness of all intrinsic define characteristic
owe to the emptiness of all thing
owe to the emptiness of non apprehension
owe to the emptiness of non entity
owe to the emptiness of essential nature
and owe to the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
that the thing associate with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non existent and non apprehensible
moreover senior śāradvatī­putra it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon
owe to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that physical form be non existent and non apprehensible
similarly senior śāradvatī­putra feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be also non existent and non apprehensible
senior śāradvatī­putra even the emptiness of internal phenomenon be non existent and non apprehensible
and in the same vein senior śāradvatī­putra the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be non existent and non apprehensible
senior śāradvatī­putra the application of mindfulness be non existent and non apprehensible
enter the stream be non existent and non apprehensible and the same go for the other fruit up to and include arhatship which be non existent and non apprehensible
the pratyekabuddha be non existent and non apprehensible
the bodhisattva be non existent and non apprehensible
senior śāradvatī­putra the buddha be non existent and non apprehensible
senior śāradvatī­putra even omniscience be non existent and non apprehensible
when they investigate and make their determination in that manner if they be not dishearten if they be not intimidate if they be not afraid if they be not terrified and if they will not be terrify
one should know that these great-bodhisattva-being will never be separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra physical form be without the nature of physical form and
this be correctly and definitively cognize when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly senior śāradvatī­putra feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be without the nature of consciousness and the other aggregate and
and this be correctly and definitively cognize by great-bodhisattva-being
in the same vein
senior śāradvatī­putra it be for this reason that one should know great-bodhisattva-being to be never separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
senior su­bhūti what be the nature of physical form
what be the nature of feeling perception and formative predisposition
what be the nature of consciousness
senior su­bhūti what be the nature of the finality of existence and so forth
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra the nature of physical form be non entity
similarly the nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non entity
the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
the unconditioned phenomena up to and include the finality of existence be without the nature of the finality of existence and the aforementioned and
senior śāradvatī­putra it be for this reason that one should know
that physical form be without the nature of physical form
and in the same vein
the nature of all attribute and unconditioned phenomenon up to and include the finality of existence be non entity
that unconditioned phenomena up to and include the finality of existence be without the define characteristic of the finality of existence and so forth
one should know that even define characteristic be without their nature and their nature be without define characteristic
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti will great-bodhisattva-being who undertake this training attain emancipation in omniscience
yes senior śāradvatī­putra it be as you have say
great-bodhisattva-being who undertake this training will attain emancipation in omniscience
if you ask why senior śāradvatī­putra it be because all thing be unborn in cyclic existence and unemancipated in nirvāṇa
senior su­bhūti why be all thing unborn and unemancipated
senior śāradvatī­putra physical form be empty of the nature of physical form and in that regard there be no birth nor be the emancipation of nirvāṇa apprehensible
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of the nature of consciousness and the other aggregate
and in that regard there be no birth nor be the emancipation of nirvāṇa apprehensible
in the same vein all attribute and unconditioned phenomenon up to and include the finality of existence be empty of the nature of the finality of existence and so forth
this complete the eleventh chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle non abide
then they be merely engage with mental image
and if they engage in the same manner with feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
also if they engage with the notion that physical form be permanent or the notion that these be impermanent
similarly if they engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be permanent or that these be impermanent
similarly if they engage with the notion that physical form be imbue with happiness or that these be imbue with suffering
similarly if they engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be imbue with happiness or that these be imbue with suffering
if they engage with the notion that the self exist in physical form or that the self do not exist therein
similarly if they engage with the notion that the self exist in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness or that the self do not exist therein
if they engage with the notion that physical form be empty or that these be not empty
similarly if they engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty or that these be not empty
if they engage with the notion that sign exist in physical form or that sign do not exist therein
then they be merely engage with mental image
similarly if they engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness cease or that these be unceasing
if they engage with the notion that entity exist in physical form or that entity do not exist therein
similarly if they engage with the notion that entity exist in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness or that entity do not exist therein
senior su­bhūti then say to the blessed one
venerable lord if when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they engage unskillfully with physical form
venerable lord when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if they unskillfully engage with the application of mindfulness
in the same vein
if they engage in the same manner with the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
if they engage in the same manner with the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
if they engage with the ten power of the tathāgata
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom think i be practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom i should cultivate it
if they think i be a bodhisattva this be a bodhisattva
if bodhisattva think those who engage in that manner be cultivate the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
one should know this to be the absence of skillful mean which great-bodhisattva-being might have
then senior su­bhūti address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if they abide in cognize and be intent on physical form
and similarly if they abide in cognize and be intent on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
then while they be abide in cognizing and intent on physical form
and similarly while they be abide in cognizing and intent on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
then they be engage in the conditioning of physical form
and in the same vein
if they abide in cognize and be intent on the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
i say they will not be release from suffer and so forth in subsequent rebirth
similarly if they abide in cognize and be intent on sight
if they abide in cognize and be intent on the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon
if they abide in cognize and be intent on feeling due to sensory contact that be visually compound and so on up to feeling due to sensory contact that be mentally compound
if they abide in cognize and be intent on the application of mindfulness and the other causal attribute
up to and include the noble eightfold path and
likewise if they abide in cognize and be intent on the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
i say they will not be release from suffer and so forth in subsequent rebirth
if they even lack the good fortune to actualize the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddha
how could they possibly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment that would be impossible
senior śāradvatī­putra when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner
they be without skill in mean and one should know they to be without skill in mean
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti how should one know that when they be practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they do possess skill in mean
senior śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being skillfully practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not engage with physical form and they do not engage with feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they do not engage with mental image of physical form and they do not engage with mental image of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they do not engage with the notion that physical form be permanent or the notion that these be impermanent
similarly they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be permanent or the notion that these be impermanent
they do not engage with the notion that physical form be imbue with happiness or the notion that these be imbue with suffering
similarly they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be imbue with happiness or the notion that these be imbue with suffering
they do not engage with the notion that physical form be a self or the notion that these be not a self
similarly they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be a self or the notion that these be not a self
they do not engage with the notion that physical form be empty or that these be not empty
similarly they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty or that these be not empty

they do not engage with the notion that physical form cease or that they be uncease
similarly they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness cease or that they be uncease
they do not engage with the notion that physical form be entity or that they be non entity
senior śāradvatī­putra when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner
one should know that they be endow with skillful mean if you be to ask why
emptiness be not other than physical form nor be physical form other than emptiness
the nature of physical form be indeed emptiness and emptiness be indeed physical form

in the same vein
the emptiness of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be not the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and the rest
emptiness be not other than the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha nor be the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha other than emptiness

then great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner will have the good fortune to actualize manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti why be it that great-bodhisattva-being when skillfully practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not accept anything at all
senior śāradvatī­putra the essential nature of that transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non apprehensible if you ask why
it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the essential nature of non entity
this be the meditative stability of great-bodhisattva-being
non acquisitive with respect to all thing the spacious immeasurable and indefinable method which be not share in common with all the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti be it that only great-bodhisattva-being who possess and be never separate from this meditative stability will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment or else be there other meditative stability through which buddhahood will be attain
senior su­bhūti reply

then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
the blessed one reply
this be owe to namelessness and non corporeality
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection be like space
he reply this be owe to the transcendence of all that be achieve by śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
he reply this be owe to their uncrushability by all thing and
owe to their undauntedness concern the understanding of the aspect of the path
then all the god inhabit the world system of desire and all the god inhabit the world system of form within this world system of the great trichiliocosm as many as they be
scatter divine flower incense joss stick nectar and black agar wood powder
the blessed one reply to those god as follow
the define characteristic of non purification and the define characteristic of non entity
they have not be condition by feeling perception and formative predisposition
nor have they be condition by consciousness
they have not be condition by the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
they have not be condition by the attribute and attainment extend from the application of mindfulness and so on up to and include omniscience
they neither have contamination nor be the without contamination
they be neither mundane nor be they supramundane and
they be neither condition nor be they unconditioned
venerable lord it be because space be unconditioned therefore it be not endow with any define characteristic whatsoever nor be it thus endow
because it be non existent and non apprehensible
the blessed one then address those god inhabit the world system of desire and those inhabit the world system of form as follow
the god then say to the blessed one
the blessed one then address the god inhabit the world system of desire and those inhabit the world system of form
similarly feeling have the define characteristic of emotional experience perception have the define characteristic of comprehensibility
formative predisposition have the define characteristic of conditioning and consciousness have the define characteristic of particularize intrinsic awareness
but the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of all their define characteristic
but the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of its define characteristic
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline have the define characteristic of non involvement
but the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of all their define characteristic
the four meditative concentration and similarly the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption have the define characteristic of non disturbance
the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment have the define characteristic of be conducive to emancipation
but the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to the absence of their define characteristic
and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha have the define characteristic of unsurpassibility
omniscience have the define characteristic of be unobscured with respect to the definitive nature of all thing
so it be su­bhūti that the tathāgata honor venerate respect and make offering to this very sacred doctrine of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti rightly would one speak if one be to say correctly that the tathāgata be grateful and thankful
it be su­bhūti because the tathāgata continuously honor venerate respect and make offering to and similarly favor and pursue the vehicle and the path that be to say the vehicle through which they have reach the level of a tathāgata and the path by which they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
senior su­bhūti then ask the blessed one
venerable lord since the tathā­gata have say that all thing be unknowable and invisible
how then do the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
venerable lord how be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom instructive because physical form be unseen
similarly how be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom instructive because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be unseen
in the same vein as before how be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom instructive because all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be unseen
su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be instructive because physical form be unseen when there be no consciousness arise that apprehend physical form
when there be no consciousness arise that apprehend feeling that apprehend perception that apprehend formative predisposition and that apprehend consciousness
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be instructive because consciousness and the other aggregate be unseen
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be instructive
because all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be unseen when there be no consciousness arise that apprehend omniscience and so forth
so it be su­bhūti that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom give rise to the tathāgata and instruct the world of sentient being
similarly it indicate to these world that the twelve sense field and the eighteen sensory element be empty
similarly it indicate to these world that the path of the ten virtuous action the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption be empty
it indicate to these world that omniscience be empty
moreover su­bhūti it be dependent on this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha reveal to the world that the five psycho physical aggregate be empty
if you ask what world it reveal to be inconceivable
it reveal the world comprise the five psycho physical aggregate the twelve sense field and the eighteen sensory element to be inconceivable
if you ask what world it reveal to be calm empty and so forth
it reveal everything from the five psycho physical aggregate up to and include omniscience to be calm
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of inconceivable deed and innumerable deed
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of great deed
similarly this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of inconceivable deed unappraisable deed and deed that be equal to the unequaled
su­bhūti if you ask how this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of great deed by mean of deed that be equal to the unequaled and so forth
this denote the great deed of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
that be to say this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish for the purpose of grant refuge to and not forsake all sentient being
for these reason su­bhūti
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of the innumerable deed of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and by mean of their deed which be equal to the unequaled and so forth
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
it be just as you have say su­bhūti that which be inconceivable
be genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata self origination and omniscience
su­bhūti that which be unappraisable
su­bhūti that which be innumerable
be genuinely perfect buddhahood the nature of the tathāgata self origination and omniscience
su­bhūti all thing be indeed inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
and in that regard mind and mental state be non existent and non apprehensible
in the same vein su­bhūti all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be non existent be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how be physical form non existent be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
similarly why be feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness non existent be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
in the same vein why be all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience non existent be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
the blessed one reply su­bhūti physical form be indeed without limit
therefore omniscience and so forth be non existent while be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
how be physical form without limit
similarly how be feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness without limit
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti physical form be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
therefore physical form be without limit
all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
therefore omniscience and the rest be without limit
su­bhūti do you think that physical form be apprehensible with respect to that which be inconceivable equal to the unequaled and so forth
or in the same vein do you think that all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be apprehensible
no venerable lord
be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
while the blessed one be deliver this chapter concern the attribute of the tathāgata which be inconceivable unappraisable innumerable and equal to the unequaled
the mind of five hundred fully ordain monk be liberate from contaminant and free from grasp which be the immediate cause of rebirth
two thousand bodhisattva come to accept that phenomenon be non arising
and they all receive prophetic declaration concern their future enlightenment within this auspicious eon
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
accordingly venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of unappraisable deed innumerable deed and deed that be equal to the unequaled
then the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have say
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of great deed
if you ask why su­bhūti
the five other transcendent-perfection be subsume within this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the emptiness of internal phenomenon be subsume within it the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be subsume within it
the four application of mindfulness be subsume within it
and in the same vein the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path be subsume within it
su­bhūti all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be subsume within this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti just as a king of the royal class who have be empower through coronation delegate all the royal function and royal duty that he exercise concern the citizen to his obedient subject and senior minister delegate responsibility so that he have few concern
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish by mean of deed that be equal to the unequaled and so forth in order that one might not appropriate or become fixate on physical form and likewise in order that one might not appropriate and become fixate on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and in the same vein as before in order that one might not appropriate and become fixate on all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
senior su­bhūti then ask the blessed one
venerable lord how be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom establish in order that one might not appropriate and become fixate on physical form
how be it establish in order that one might not appropriate and become fixate on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
how be it establish in order that one might not appropriate and become fixate on all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
then the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti do you consider those physical form which the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon
no venerable lord
the blessed one continue
su­bhūti do you consider those feeling those perception those formative predisposition and those mode of consciousness that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon
su­bhūti do you consider those attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon
that be it that be it su­bhūti it be just as you have say
i also do not consider those physical form that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon
i also do not consider those attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom could appropriate or become fixate upon
so it be that the bodhisattvas who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not appropriate or become fixate on physical form
all those sentient being in the world system of the great trichiliocosm as many as they be who have become follower through faith
and similarly those who have become follower of the sacred doctrine who have reach the eighth level
who have enter the stream who be tie to one more rebirth
who be no long subject to rebirth who have attain arhatship
when any who accept this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom for but a single day wish for it appraise it or investigate it
if one be to ask why
and who have become pratyekabuddha
it be because in contrast to the cognition and exertion of those who have become follower through faith and similarly the cognition and exertion of those who have become pratyekabuddha
great-bodhisattva-being have accept that phenomenon be non arising
then the blessed one address those god inhabit the world system of desire and those god inhabit the world system of form as follow
o god it be so it be so it be just as you have say
i say that when any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who have hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom who having hear it aspire toward it
who having aspire toward it commit it to write or have it commit to writing
or who after similarly hold and teach it be attentive in the correct manner to the pristine cognition of genuinely perfect buddhahood
those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will more swiftly attain final nirvāṇa by mean of the pristine cognition of genuinely perfect buddhahood
those son or daughter who be follower of the vehicle of the śrāvaka
who practice accord to other sūtra apart from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom for an eon or long than an eon
if you ask why o god
it be because those perfect doctrine associate with the attainment of manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be extensively reveal in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom consequent on the doctrine in which follower through faith and so on up to and include those who have attain arhatship and those who have become pratyekabuddha should train and the doctrine in which great-bodhisattva-being have train
then the god inhabit the world system of desire and those inhabit the world system of form say
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the unappraisable transcendent-perfection the innumerable transcendent-perfection and the transcendent-perfection that be equal to the unequaled
and they will attain final nirvāṇa in which no residue of the psycho physical aggregate be leave behind yet this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will neither be diminish nor replenish
and immediately after hear it form aspiration toward it and as before commit it to write retain hold and master it
and be always attentive to it in the correct manner and so forth from where will they pass away and be reborn into this human world
su­bhūti those individual who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas immediately having hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom form aspiration toward it
when those who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas immediately after hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom form aspiration toward it
and as before commit it to write retain hold and master it
and be always attentive to it in the correct manner those individual who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will exclusively pass away among humankind and be reborn among humankind
those individual who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas in this way after hearing retain hold master and be attentive to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the correct manner in their former life
will through these root of virtuous action abandon the eight unfavorable condition and be reborn among humankind
have in the above manner commit it to write compile it as a book and then honor revere and respect it with flower garland unguent powder butter lamp incense clothing parasol victory banner and ribbon
individual endow with enlighten attribute who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
have honor the lord buddhas in other buddhafield
and similarly retain hold and be attentive to it in the correct manner
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
if you ask why
those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva have previously hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom from the lord buddhas in other buddhafield
through these root of virtuous action after they pass away they have be reborn in this human world
su­bhūti it be because those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have be bear in the abode of tuṣita have question and counter question the great bodhisattva be maitreya concern this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who in former life hear and receive clear instruction in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and who have be reborn in this human world without having have an opportunity to pose question and counter question and who when they now hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
harbor doubt hesitation and disillusionment with regard to this same profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who in former life have hear and receive clear instruction in this profundity of the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
harbor doubt hesitation and disillusionment with regard to it
moreover su­bhūti there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who in former life have hear and receive clear instruction on the emptiness of internal phenomenon and similarly on the emptiness of external phenomenon and on all the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
moreover su­bhūti there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who in former life have hear and receive clear instruction on the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative absorption the ten power of the tathāgata the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and so forth
su­bhūti those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva who have embark on this vehicle but who not long after
be not accept by a spiritual mentor and do not revere many buddha
do not commit this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to writing nor do they retain hold and master it
nor do they read it aloud recite it confer its transmission or be attentive to it in the correct manner
they have not even train in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
nor have they train in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and they have not train in the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative absorption the ten power of the tathāgata the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and so forth
you should know that
if you ask why
it be because those who do not commit this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to writing who do not have it commit to writing who neither retain hold nor master it and who neither read it aloud nor recite it and who do not confer its transmission and be not attentive to it in the correct manner have not apply themselves earnestly as instruct in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti one should know that this be like when an ocean go vessel or a great ship be wreck at sea
will surely encounter death without reach the ocean shore
the people on board who wish to save their life but who do not catch and hold on to a wooden plank log leather bag or human corpse
su­bhūti it be like when an ocean go vessel or a great ship be wreck at sea and the people on board who wish to save their life do catch and hold on to a wooden plank log leather bag or human corpse
and will safely and securely stand upon the ocean shore uninjured and unharmed
however su­bhūti if those individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who be endow with faith tolerance serene joy confidence high aspiration volition and renunciation
who relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain
that faith that tolerance that confidence that high aspiration that willingness that volition that renunciation and that unrelenting perseverance until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain will increase and flourish since they have be accept by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in the same way su­bhūti when other individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who be endow with faith tolerance confidence high aspiration willingness volition and renunciation
they will similarly be unskille with respect to the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly be unskille they will be without the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of external phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly be unskille they will be without the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
in the same vein be unskille they will not have cultivate the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
since such individual be unskille do not become familiar with omniscience
they will degenerate from those superior attribute due to their inappropriate action which be only associate with interim state
su­bhūti just as when a man or a woman fetch water from a river waterfall lake pool pond or well with a clay jar that have be fire
this man or woman who be fetch the water should be know as skillful in nature
in the same way su­bhūti individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who be endow with faith tolerance confidence high aspiration willingness volition and renunciation
similarly they should know that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have be favor by the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein by all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti apart from the maritime merchant other who be skilled in mean should know that because of that this ship will not safely and securely cross to the other shore of the ocean but will just disintegrate halfway across and that the ship the cargo and the merchant who be unskille in mean will be separate and owe to inappropriate conduct a catastrophe will ensue
in the same way su­bhūti when individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva be endow with faith tolerance confidence high aspiration willingness volition and renunciation
and relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain but nonetheless lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be without skill in mean
other great-bodhisattva-being should know that for that reason those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have not be favor by the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti it be like when a maritime merchant who be skilled in mean embark on the ocean having properly construct caulk repair and sweep clean his ocean go ship
then su­bhūti other great-bodhisattva-being should know that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have be favor by the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and similarly by the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have be favor by all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
those great-bodhisattva-being will not owe to inappropriate action degenerate from those superior attribute to the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
uninjured and unharmed you should know that they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti if for example the body of an aged and decrepit old man who have reach the age of two thousand be to succumb to some illness due to wind bile or phlegm disorder or to a combination of these
do you think su­bhūti that this man would be able to rise from his bed unaide
no venerable lord
if one be to ask why venerable lord it be because that man would be waste by old age and illness
be without skill in mean
other bodhisattva should know that alas for this reason those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and similarly by the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have not be favor by all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti it be just as when the body of that same aged and decrepit old man who have reach the age of two thousand
have succumb to some illness due to wind bile or phlegm disorder or to a combination of these
but he still wish to rise from his bed
and two strong man then arrive and support he on his left and right side
say come here man
wherever you wish to go whatever your mind seek and wherever it wish to go with our support you should not have the slight fear of fall down however far you go in the same way
su­bhūti when individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattva be endow with faith tolerance confidence high aspiration willingness volition and renunciation
and relentlessly persevere until unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain
for this reason other bodhisattva apart from they should know that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have be favor by the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and similarly by the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have be favor by all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
if you ask why it be because they be not separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they be not without skill in mean
su­bhūti if you ask how individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas can lack skill in mean
there be su­bhūti some individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who from the very beginning dispense gift while they lack skill in mean
i possess tolerance
i be undertake perseverance i possess perseverance
i be absorb in meditative concentration
i possess wisdom
similarly they make assumption that ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom be theirs
they make assumption on account of that wisdom and so forth
and they make assumption about wisdom and so forth
through their generosity ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom which resort to notion of i and mine they augment the round of cyclic existence itself
and they be not liberate from the suffering associate with birth and so forth
similarly in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom there be no such concept
if you ask why it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest be not transcendent-perfection
su­bhūti when individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas dispense gift
if they do not understand the limitation of perception they have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly when they maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance become equipoise in meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom if they do not understand the limitation of perception
they have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
they have not be favor by omniscience and they will regress to the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
then if you ask how unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attain without regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
in this regard su­bhūti there be individual follower of the vehicle of the bodhisattvas who owe to their skill in mean from the very beginning give gift with a mind that do not resort to notion of i and mine
i possess wisdom
similarly they do not make assumption with regard to that ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom
they do not make assumption on account of that wisdom and so forth they do not make assumption on account of the act of wisdom and so forth and they do not make assumption about the act of wisdom and so forth
similarly in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline there be no such concept and so they do not make assumption
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest be not transcendent-perfection
by the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom because they be excellently favor by those six transcendent-perfection
venerable lord how should those great-bodhisattva-being who be beginner train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
how should they train in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the blessed one then reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
and similarly those who wish to train in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity should rely upon and venerate spiritual mentor who can confer instruction in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and similarly those who can confer instruction in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
will grant instruction in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to those bodhisattva
come son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
you should dedicate whatever gift you have offer to all sentient being make common cause with all sentient being and without apprehend anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
you should not misconstrue the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as physical form
similarly you should not misconstrue it as feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness
similarly you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the path
you should not misconstrue unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddhahood as the five extrasensory power and in the same vein as before as omniscience
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
bodhisattva wish to train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and similarly since they wish to train in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
who genuinely offer instruction in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and who similarly offer instruction in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
say
you should dedicate whatever gift you have offer to all sentient being make common cause with all sentient being and without apprehend anything toward the attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the emptiness of internal phenomenon as the emptiness of external phenomenon as the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon and as the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly you should not misconstrue this unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment as the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the path
they rely on and venerate spiritual mentor
if they have not misconstrue the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will subsequently attain this omniscience
similarly if they have not misconstrue the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly if they have not misconstrue the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the path
if they have not misconstrue the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
do not generate desire for the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not generate desire for the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the five extrasensory power
do not generate desire for the ten power of the tathāgata
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being who strive toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and who wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be engage in a difficult task inasmuch as all thing be empty of their own define characteristic
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being set out sentient being for the benefit of the world
practice the six transcendent-perfection
in this regard su­bhūti
great-bodhisattva-being themselves abide on the path of the ten virtuous action
and subsequently establish other sentient being too on the path of the ten virtuous action
the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomenon and the sensory element of mental consciousness be always without fear
similarly the transcendence of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odor and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of taste and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangible and the sensory element of tactile consciousness and the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomenon and the sensory element of mental consciousness be not the sensory element of mental consciousness and the rest
similarly the transcendence of the understanding of all phenomenon the understanding of the aspect of the path and omniscience be not omniscience and the rest
venerable lord if all thing indeed accord with the transcendence of all thing then
if one be to ask why venerable lord
in the transcendence of physical form there be no conceptual notion and similarly in the transcendence of feeling the transcendence of perception the transcendence of formative predisposition and the transcendence of consciousness there be no conceptual notion likewise in the transcendence of all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience there be no conceptual notion that these be physical form
and in the same vein that these be attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
the blessed one reply
let we reveal these profound sacred doctrine to sentient being
it be in this way su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being act as an ally of the world
just as su­bhūti island consist of land that be confine by water on all side whether by river lake sea or ocean
in the same way su­bhūti physical form be confine by the limit of past time and the limit of future time
great-bodhisattva-being after manifestly and perfectly comprehend just that alone teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be confine by the limit of past time and the limit of future time
great-bodhisattva-being after manifestly and perfectly comprehend just that alone teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be confine by the limit of past time and the limit of future time
after actually realize those very truth impart by the lord buddhas
they maintain they just as they be and also teach they to sentient being
encourage sentient being to maintain they authentically as well and establish they securely therein
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being reveal to sentient being who have go astray on mistaken path or who be bind for inferior realm the sole path by traverse which sentient being will achieve purification on which suffering and discomfort will subside and where sublime attribute will be realize and nirvāṇa actualize
similarly they reveal to sentient being the sacred doctrine that the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and omniscience all neither arise nor cease and that they be neither defile nor purified
in this regard su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva they attract sentient being by mean of the four attractive quality of a bodhisattva namely generosity pleasant speech purposeful activity and harmony
then they teach those same sentient being the sacred doctrine that physical form have the modality of space
similarly they teach the sacred doctrine that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness have the modality of space
similarly they teach sentient being the sacred doctrine that future feeling perception and formative predisposition along with future consciousness be all emptiness that they will arise from nowhere and that they will proceed to nowhere
in the same vein as before su­bhūti all thing have a modality that neither arise nor cease and be neither defile nor purify
great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
su­bhūti all thing have the modality of non conditioning
su­bhūti all thing have the modality of a magical display the reflection of the moon in water a dream an optical aberration an echo and a phantom
great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
su­bhūti all thing have a modality that be neither diminish nor enhance
su­bhūti all thing have a modality that do not arise
all thing have a modality that be neither to be adopt nor to be forsake and so forth
su­bhūti all thing have a modality of disassociation
su­bhūti all thing have a modality that be without a self
in the same vein as before su­bhūti
all thing have a modality free from sentient being free from living creature free from living organism free from life free from individual free from humankind free from human being free from petitioner free from instigator free from actor free from agent free from knower and free from viewer
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because in this modality a self never exist and it be non apprehensible similarly this modality be free from sentient being living creature living organism live individual humankind human being petitioner instigator actor agent knower and viewer and these be non apprehensible
su­bhūti it be because permanence happiness self and all those attribute up to and include attractiveness never exist and they be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come and go
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of real nature
they have the modality of the expanse of reality they have the modality of the finality of existence they have the modality of sameness and they have the modality of the inconceivable expanse
a modality that be unattractive
great-bodhisattva-being too do not transgress this modality
su­bhūti all thing have a modality that be unmove
su­bhūti it be because the motion that would enable anything to go or to come do not at all exist and be non apprehensible
su­bhūti all thing have the modality of physical form
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
generosity never exist and be non apprehensible
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom
ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom never exist and be non apprehensible
how could there possibly be a transcendent-perfection of this ethical discipline a transcendent-perfection of this tolerance a transcendent-perfection of this perseverance a transcendent-perfection of this meditative concentration and a transcendent-perfection of this wisdom
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the emptiness of internal phenomenon
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the emptiness of external phenomenon
and the modality of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity
the noble eightfold path and the rest never exist and be non apprehensible
how could they possibly come or go
similarly su­bhūti all thing have the modality of the ten power of the tathāgata
all thing have the modality of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
the fruit of enter the stream never exist and be non apprehensible
and individual enlightenment do not exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come or go
unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment never exist and be non apprehensible this be the case how could they possibly come or go
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who formerly work toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment who have maintain purity of conduct in the presence of the genuinely perfect buddha of the past
venerable lord what will be the essential nature of the mind of those great-bodhisattva-being who have conviction in and concur with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
what will be their sign and what will be their form
venerable lord what will be the modality of those great-bodhisattva-being who have conviction and concur with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being who undertake non acquisitive cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord be this cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the non cultivation of all thing
in that case su­bhūti with regard to which thing be the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom a non cultivation
similarly the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be the non cultivation of a self sentient being living creature living organism live individual humankind human being actor agent petitioner instigator experiencer experience subject knower and viewer
be the non cultivation of the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be the non cultivation of the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of external phenomenon and of all the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity
be the non cultivation of the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the aspect of the path
be the non cultivation of the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment
be the non cultivation of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
be the non cultivation of the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty
m be the non cultivation of sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
be the non cultivation of the sensory element of sight and the sensory element of visual consciousness
be the non cultivation of the sensory element of the ear the sensory element of sound and the sensory element of auditory consciousness
be the non cultivation of the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odor and the sensory element of olfactory consciousness
be the non cultivation of the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of taste and the sensory element of gustatory consciousness
be the non cultivation of the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangible and the sensory element of tactile consciousness
be the non cultivation of the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomenon and the sensory element of mental consciousness
be the non cultivation of the understanding of all phenomenon and the understanding of the aspect of the path
su­bhūti in term of this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom those bodhisattva of irreversible realization should investigate the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and in the same vein all the other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
some great-bodhisattva-being be not fixate on this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
comprehend that the word speak by other be pointless and contrary to the truth
they will not proceed through faith in other
and they will not be captivate by desire hatred delusion or by the mind with its five aspect of concomitance and its afflict mental state
some great-bodhisattva-being
when they practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
will not be separate from the transcendent-perfection of generosity
their mind will not be avert from the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they will delight in hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
when those great-bodhisattva-being hold this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will not be afraid and terrified they will not grow fearful and they will not be cow and intimidate
when they hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will hold retain master and be attentive in the appropriate manner to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how when maintain this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should those great-bodhisattva-being practice this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
whose mind will not be avert from the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and who additionally will hold and be attentive in the appropriate manner and so forth to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they should conduct themselves with their mind intent on omniscience
how should their mind be intent on omniscience
with their mind intent on the real nature
and likewise with their mind intent on the unaltered real nature intent on the expanse of reality intent on the finality of existence and intent on the sameness of all thing intent on the inconceivable expanse and
similarly with their mind intent on the simile of a magical display a mirage the moon ’s reflection in water a dream an optical aberration an echo and a phantom
venerable lord when those great-bodhisattva-being practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with their mind intent on emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not engage with physical form
manifestly perfect buddhahood can not be attain
by mean of physical form feeling perception formative predisposition consciousness generosity ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration or wisdom or in the same vein even by mean of all attribute and attainment up to and include the pristine cognition of omniscience
the nature of physical form be omniscience
and similarly the nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be omniscience
the real nature of physical form and the real nature of omniscience be one and the same real nature
similarly the real nature of omniscience along with the real nature of the understanding of the aspect of the path and
the real nature of the understanding of all phenomenon be all one and the same real nature
then all the god inhabit the world system of desire and all the god inhabit the world system of form scatter divine sandalwood powder incense palm leaf powder divine blue lotus night lotus and white lotus toward the lord buddha
come into the presence of the blessed one they prostrate with their head at his foot
and take their place to one side
having take their place to one side those god then say to the blessed one
for the real nature of physical form
and similarly the real nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
be one and the same real nature as the real nature of omniscience
they be not two but indivisible
the real nature of the eye
similarly the real nature of the ear nose tongue body and mental faculty
similarly sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon be themselves omniscience
and omniscience be mental phenomenon and the aforementioned sense object
for the real nature of sight
for the real nature of the sensory element of the eye
for the real nature of mental consciousness and the rest
and omniscience be the sensory element of mental consciousness and the rest
for the real nature of the noble eightfold path and so forth
for the real nature of all the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
the blessed one then address those god as follow
o god it be so it be just as you have say
for the real nature of physical form
similarly the real nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
the real nature of all causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
if you ask why o god
this doctrine be profound hard to discern and hard to realize it can not be scrutinize
it may be know by the wise and by those skilled in subtle investigation
o god this be the profundity of all thing in which the habitual idea of duality do not at all exist
and owe to the profundity of non arising non cessation non affliction and non purification
and similarly this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
o god this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of the sensory element of the ear the sensory element of sound and the sensory element of auditory consciousness
similarly o god this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly o god this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of the emptiness of internal phenomenon and owe to the profundity of the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of condition phenomenon the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thing the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic the emptiness of non apprehension the emptiness of non entity the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly o god this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of the application of mindfulness and likewise owe to the profundity of the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
similarly o god this doctrine be profound owe to the profundity of the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and owe to the attainment up to and include omniscience
then the god say to the blessed one
if one be to ask why
this doctrine have not be reveal so that physical form might be grasp or not grasp
and it have not be reveal so that the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom might be grasp or not grasp
and it have not be reveal so that the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of condition phenomenon the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thing the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic the emptiness of non apprehension the emptiness of non entity the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity might be grasp or not grasp

it have not be reveal so that the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha might be grasp or not grasp
similarly venerable lord this doctrine have not be reveal so that the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and omniscience might be grasp or not grasp
venerable lord the world indulge in notion of i and mine say i identify with physical form similarly i identify with feeling i identify with perception i identify with formative predisposition i possess formative predisposition i identify with consciousness similarly i identify with the eye i possess eye i identify with the ear i possess ear and so with the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty
i identify with individual enlightenment i identify with omniscience i possess omniscience
theblessed one then address those god as follow
it be so o god it be just as you have say
similarly it have not be reveal so that the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of condition phenomenon emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thing the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic the emptiness of non apprehension the emptiness of non entity the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity might be grasp or not grasp
and likewise it have not be reveal so that the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path might be grasp or not grasp
o god this sacred doctrine have not be reveal so that the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment might be grasp or not grasp
and similarly who practice in order that they might grasp or reject sight sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
and similarly who practice in order that they might grasp or reject the sensory element of the eye the sensory element of sight and the sensory element of visual consciousness
the sensory element of the ear the sensory element of sound
the sensory element of tactile consciousness the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomenon and the sensory element of mental consciousness
and similarly those who practice in order that they might grasp or reject the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the emptiness of internal phenomenon
the emptiness of non apprehension the emptiness of non entity the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
those who practice in order that they might grasp or reject
the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the application of mindfulness
the emptiness of non apprehension the emptiness of non entity the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
and likewise the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
the ten power of the tathāgata
similarly they can not cultivate the ten power of the tathāgata and in the same vein they can not cultivate the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord this sacred doctrine be compatible with all thing
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the application of mindfulness
this sacred doctrine be compatible with the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
owe to its sameness with space
similarly owe to its sameness with the abide nature of all thing the finality of existence and the inconceivable expanse
it have the define characteristic of be unobstructed with regard to all phenomenon causal and fruitional attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
owe to the non apprehension of the arising of physical form
owe to the non apprehension of the arising of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
this sacred doctrine be non arising
owe to the non apprehension of the ground of physical form
and in the same vein owe to the imperceptbility of the ground of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
this sacred doctrine be groundless
this imply that the elder su­bhūti be the emulator of the tathā­gata because he be an emulator of something
if the eld su­bhūti be the emulator of the tathā­gata because he be the emulator of the real nature
the real nature of the tathā­gata be also the real nature of all thing
the real nature of all thing be also the real nature of the tathā­gata
in which case too the elder su­bhūti be the emulator of the tathā­gata
just as the real nature of the tathā­gata be unobstructed in all respect the real nature of all thing be also unobstructed in all respect
the real nature of the tathā­gata and
the real nature of all thing be one and the same real nature they be not two but indivisible
this real nature be uncreated
it be never not the real nature
for which reason it always be the real nature therefore they be not two but indivisible
just as the real nature of the tathā­gata be undifferentiated non particular and without duality
in the same way the elder su­bhūti be the emulator of the tathā­gata
the real nature of the tathā­gata be not distinct from the real nature of all thing
it be never not the real nature
in this case too the elder su­bhūti be undifferentiated and therefore he be the emulator of the tathā­gata
similarly the real nature of all thing be also not the past not the future and not the present
in this case too the elder su­bhūti be say to be the emulator of the tathā­gata
the real nature of the past be the real nature of the tathā­gata and
the real nature of the tathā­gata be the real nature of the past
the real nature of the future be the real nature of the tathā­gata and
the real nature of the tathā­gata be the real nature of the future
the real nature of the past future and present and the real nature of the tathā­gata be one and the same real nature they be not two but indivisible
similarly the real nature of physical form and the real nature of the tathā­gata and likewise the real nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and the real nature of the tathā­gata be one and the same real nature they be not two but indivisible
similarly the real nature of the self and so on up to and include the real nature of the knower and the viewer and the real nature of the tathā­gata be one and the same real nature they be not two but indivisible
similarly the real nature of the transcendent-perfection of generosity and
the real nature of the tathā­gata and similarly the real nature of the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the real nature of the tathā­gata be one and the same real nature
similarly the real nature of the application of mindfulness and the real nature of the tathā­gata and
similarly the real nature of all causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and the real nature of the tathā­gata be one and the same real nature they be not two but indivisible
when su­bhūti have deliver the exegesis of this chapter on the real nature
the mighty earth of the world system of the great trichiliocosm quake quake more intensely and quake with utmost intensity it shake shake more intensely and shake with utmost intensity it vibrate vibrate more intensely and vibrate with utmost intensity and it do so in six way
then the god inhabit the world system of desire and the god inhabit the world system of form
scatter scatter more vigorously and scatter with utmost vigor divine sandalwood powder divine incense palm leaf powder divine blue lotus divine day lotus night lotus and white lotus toward the lord śākyamuni and the elder su­bhūti
in the same vein he do not emulate any other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
he do not emulate feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
he do not emulate the real nature of consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate
he do not emulate anything other than consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate
he do not emulate anything other than the real nature of consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate
o god it be because all those thing which one might emulate from which emulation might arise and into which emulation might subside be non existent and non apprehensible
when even physical form be themselves non apprehensible in the real nature
how could one possibly apprehend the real nature of physical form
similarly when even feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be themselves non apprehensible
how could one possibly apprehend the real nature of omniscience and the rest
and yet śāradvatī­putra these great-bodhisattva-being have not be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they be without skill in mean
for these reason they have diverse perception and different mode of conduct
this be a gift
i should be equipoise in such meditative concentration
harbor notion such as
senior śāradvatī­putra then ask the blessed one
venerable lord why be it that those person who follow the vehicle of the śrāvaka or the pratyekabuddha cultivate the nature of thing that be emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness but
without be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and without skill in mean
merely actualize the finality of existence and become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddha
whereas great-bodhisattva-being who also cultivate the nature of thing that be emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and be endow with skill in mean
the blessed one then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
and who be without skill in mean and who when cultivate the nature of thing that be emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddha
and having set out have second thought on the way down
wish now i should stay among the god of the trāyastriṃśa realm without descend to jambu­dvīpa
do you think śāradvatī­putra that this wingless bird would be able to resettle among the god of the trāyastriṃśa realm
o may i land in jambu­dvīpa without be wound or injure
do you think śāradvatī­putra that this wingless bird would land in jambu­dvīpa without be wound or injure
similarly śāradvatī­putra when person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas even after dispense generosity and similarly maintain their ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance achieve meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom over many eon
if you ask why it be because the mind of those person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattva be without omniscience
when they meditate on these thing over many eon dispense generosity and similarly maintain their ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance achieve meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom
inasmuch as they be not favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and be without skill in mean
they will be attentive to that talk conceptualize it and having do so they will even dedicate this toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
dispense generosity maintain ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance and be equipoise in meditative concentration without be separate from the mental cultivation of omniscience
will not be without the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and skill in mean
consequently they will not conceptualize the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past future and present nor their meditative stability wisdom liberation and perception of liberate pristine cognition
even though those great-bodhisattva-being may have dispense generosity from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment they have not conceptualize it
indeed they have not conceptualize the ethical discipline of the lord buddhas of the past future and present nor their meditative stability wisdom liberation or perception of liberate pristine cognition
practice in accordance with omniscience be skilled in the mean of great-bodhisattva-being
as i understand the meaning of the word speak by the blessed one
there be no doubt that those great-bodhisattva-being who from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment have not be without the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and skill in mean will attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
those great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
have never apprehend anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood or through which they would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood or on the basis of which they would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood from physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness up to and include omniscience
venerable lord those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
and who be not separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and skill in mean
have not conceptualize the generosity which they have dispense
nor have they conceptualize the tolerance which they have cultivate the perseverance which they have undertake the meditative concentration in which they have become equipoise or the wisdom which they have cultivate
will undoubtedly attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
this be the case it be for these reason that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
this be the case venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment through their high aspiration
be favor by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and be not without skill in mean
abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and endow with skill in mean with a mind that be free from conceptualization they should dispense their generosity and similarly maintain their ethical discipline cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance become equipoise in meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom
it be astonishing that great-bodhisattva-being should indeed attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all thing without exception while venerable lord all those thing be indeed non existent and non apprehensible
ultimately however there be nothing apprehend with respect to which i would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood or nothing by which i would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood or nothing on the basis of which i would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
venerable lord when the blessed one just say o god unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be hard to manifest
it seem that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be easy to manifest and it be easy to attain manifestly perfect enlightenment
if one be to ask why venerable lord it be because all thing be empty of all thing manifestly perfect buddhahood will not be attain with respect to anything at all or indeed by anything at all all thing be empty anything with respect to which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attain anything by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attain and anything on the basis of which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attain be non existent and non apprehensible
all thing be empty of all thing and
even those which great-bodhisattva-being seek to reduce or enhance while they dispense generosity
and in the same vein engage with omniscience and so forth venerable lord for these reason
physical form be empty of their own essential nature
all other phenomenon causal and fruitional attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be empty of their own essential nature
once great-bodhisattva-being accept that all thing resemble space they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one

do you think that those great-bodhisattva-being would generate many merit on this basis
venerable lord there would be many merit
when anyone enter into union with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be reveal they will generate many merit great than those
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom offer donation to those who have enter the stream over eon equal in number to the sand of the river ganges and
similarly when they offer donation to those who be tie to one more rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth those who be arhat and those who be pratyekabuddha
venerable lord there would be many merit they would be immeasurable venerable su­gata
when anyone enter into union with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be reveal they will generate many merit great than those
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being who practice this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha and after transcend the maturity of the bodhisattvas they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom over eon equal in number to the sand of the river ganges offer their generosity maintain their ethical discipline practice tolerance cultivate perseverance become equipoise in meditative concentration and cultivate wisdom do you think that they would generate many merit on this basis
when anyone enter into union with this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be reveal for just a few day
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom over eon equal in number to the sand of the river ganges offer their gift of the sacred doctrine to all sentient being do you think that they would generate many merit on this basis
when anyone abide in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be reveal and offer the gift of the sacred doctrine for only one day they will generate many merit great than those
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being who lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom also lack omniscience and great-bodhisattva-being who do not lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom also do not lack omniscience
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom over eon equal in number to the sand of the river ganges enter into union with the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the three gateway to liberation
do you think that they would generate many merit on this basis
when anyone abide in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and enter into those causal attribute from the four application of mindfulness up to and include the three gateway to liberation for only a single day they will generate many merit great than those
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because they will lack certain circumstance and lack certain opportunity that be to say there be no circumstance in which great-bodhisattva-being who do not lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will turn away from omniscience
as for those who be prone to such circumstance and opportunity this concern the circumstance in which great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom might turn away from omniscience
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being should never lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom over eon equal in number to the sand of the river ganges offer their worldly gift and their gift of the sacred doctrine
do you think that they would generate many merit on this basis
when anyone abide in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and even for a single day offer gift of the sacred doctrine and worldly gift
su­bhūti when certain great-bodhisattva-being lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom over eon equal in number to the sand of the river ganges rejoice in all the root of virtuous action of the lord buddhas of the past future and present along with their monastic community of śrāvakas and dedicate their merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being
do you think that they would generate many merit on this basis
venerable lord how should great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom investigate the meditative stability of emptiness
how should they become equipoise in the meditative stability of emptiness
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because such bodhisattva will have train well with regard to those phenomenon which be empty of their own define characteristic they neither enhance nor delimit any phenomenon they will not actualize they
if you ask why it be because ultimately they do not consider anything which actualize anything by which actualization take place or anything that be to be actualize
venerable lord when the blessed one say that great-bodhisattva-being should not actualize the notion that all thing be empty
how then venerable lord do great-bodhisattva-being abide in emptiness and realize emptiness
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being discern emptiness in all its fine aspect
they do not think that they should actualize it
but discern that they should investigate it
they discern that this be not the time for actualization and discern that this be the time for investigation
even though they may be free from contaminant still they do not actualize anything at all
this be the time for cultivate the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
this be not the time for cultivate the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth nor be it the time for cultivate the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth for cultivate the fruit of arhatship or for cultivate individual enlightenment
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
investigate emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness but they do not actualize the attribute associate with emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness as the finality of existence
in the same vein they investigate the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path but they do not actualize the finality of existence
and on those occasion the crowd of common people would indeed honor he respect he and grant he offering cause he again to rejoice in joy utter joy and at ease
if he be then for some purpose to escort his parent brother sister wife son daughter and daughter in law enter a remote and hair raise wilderness where childish person be afraid
he would exhort his parent brother sister wife son daughter and daughter in law as they go in do not fear i will get you out safely and securely and swiftly release you from this fearful and most terrifying place
would lead his parent brother sister wife son daughter and daughter in law from that wilderness safely and securely
and get they back to a village city or market town
make sure that they stay there joyful comfortable unharmed and uninjured
similarly su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being have achieve and maintain a state of mind that be imbue with love kindness compassion empathetic joy and equanimity
at that time those great-bodhisattva-being be establish in the four immeasurable aspiration and they perfect the six transcendent-perfection
for example su­bhūti a bird do not fall to the ground even though it move through the air
it fly through the sky but do not dwell therein and be unsullie
similarly su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being investigate the gateway to liberation emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
and they be even establish therein
but they do not actualize those gateway to liberation emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness which when actualize would cause they to regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha without perfect the attainment of omniscience by mean of the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and then fire a succession of other arrow one after another
he can prevent that first arrow from fall to the ground as long as he wish
but if he be to think alas i wish this arrow would fall to the ground
and he then cease to fire the subsequent arrow far into the sky
venerable lord how wonderful it be venerable lord that while great-bodhisattva-being have train in this reality train in the finality of existence train in the real nature train in the expanse of reality train in the emptiness that transcend extreme train in the emptiness of independent characteristic and train in the three gateway to liberation and so forth the difficult achievement of great-bodhisattva-being be that they do not regress in the interim before attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti such great-bodhisattva-being do not forsake all sentient being and
they maintain such extraordinary aspiration
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being magnanimously think i will not forsake all sentient being i alone should release all those sentient being who maintain inauthentic doctrine
one should know that the non actualization of the finality of existence by great-bodhisattva-being until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment indicate their skill in mean with respect to emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness as gateway to liberation
they always analyze the three gateway to liberation
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being always analyze the profound topic which be as follow the emptiness of internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity and similarly the four application of mindfulness and other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path

what constitute that phenomenon designate by the term bodhisattva
when you say that great-bodhisattva-being who continue to engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom deserve respect

as indicate above in the context of the psycho physical aggregate the same refrain should be apply extensively to all those other phenomenological category
the blessed one reply śāradvatī­putra it be so it be so
great-bodhisattva-being who abide accordingly in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not apprehend the designation of physical form
in the same vein they do not apprehend all the other designation concern physical form up to and include the designation of physical form as non entity
likewise they do not apprehend the designation of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and in the same vein they do not apprehend their further designation start from there and continue up to the designation of consciousness as a non entity
in the same vein they do not apprehend the designation of fundamental ignorance and they do not apprehend the designation of the other link of dependent origination up to and include the designation of aging and death
in the same vein they do not apprehend the designation of these link of dependent origination as non entity and so forth as state above in the context of the psycho physical aggregate the same refrain should also be apply extensively to all those other phenomenological category
it be in this way that they should train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it be in this way that they should train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this complete the fifth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle designation of a bodhisattva
śāradvatī­putra you say that you do not consider any phenomenon which may be designate by the term bodhisattva
indeed śāradvatī­putra phenomenon do not consider phenomenon
nor śāradvatī­putra do phenomenon consider the expanse of reality
the sensory element of sight do not consider the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality consider the sensory element of sight
in the same way the expanse of reality do not consider any other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of consciousness
nor do the sensory element of consciousness and so forth consider the expanse of reality
śāradvatī­putra the sensory element of the eye do not consider the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality consider the sensory element of the eye
in the same vein the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of the mental faculty do not consider the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality consider those other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of the mental faculty
the sensory element of visual consciousness do not consider the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality consider the sensory element of visual consciousness
the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness do not consider the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality consider those other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness
if you ask why śāradvatī­putra it be because condition element do not consider unconditioned element and because unconditioned element do not consider condition element
śāradvatī­putra unconditioned element can not be designate except in term of condition element and condition element can not be designate except in term of unconditioned element
śāradvatī­putra unconditioned element can not be designate except in term of condition element
condition element can not be designate except in term of unconditioned element
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord if phenomenon do not consider phenomena
and in the same vein all other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness do not consider the expanse of reality
then in that case venerable lord what be the meaning of the term great bodhisattva be
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra the meaning of the term bodhisattva be a meaningless term
if you ask why
śāradvatī­putra it be because the meaning of the term bodhisattva be without identity
for this reason the meaning of the term bodhisattva be a meaningless term
śāradvatī­putra just as track of bird in the sky be non existent in the same way the meaning of the term bodhisattva be non existent
śāradvatī­putra just as a dream have no basis in the same way śāradvatī­putra the meaning of the term bodhisattva be non existent
śāradvatī­putra just as a magical display be without foundation
in the same way śāradvatī­putra the meaning of the term bodhisattva be non existent
śāradvatī­putra just as a mirage be without foundation
just as an echo an optical aberration the reflection of the moon in water and a phantom emanation of the tathāgata be without foundation
śāradvatī­putra just as the real nature be without foundation
in the same way the unmistaken real nature the reality the expanse of reality and maturity with respect to all thing be without foundation
śāradvatī­putra just as the finality of existence be without foundation
in the same way śāradvatī­putra the meaning of the term bodhisattva be non existent
śāradvatī­putra just as the physical form of an illusory person be without foundation
in the same way the aggregate of feeling the aggregate of perception the aggregate of formative predisposition and the aggregate of consciousness be without foundation
śāradvatī­putra just as the eye of an illusory person be without foundation
in the same way their other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty be without foundation
the same go for the external sense field which be also without foundation start from the sense field of sight through to the sense field of mental phenomenon likewise
śāradvatī­putra just as the notion of an illusory person engage in the emptiness of internal phenomenon be without foundation
in the same way śāradvatī­putra the meaning of the term bodhisattva as a great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non existent
in the same vein just as the notion of an illusory person engage in all the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be without foundation
śāradvatī­putra just as the notion of an illusory person practice the ten power of the tathāgata be without foundation
in the same vein just as the notion of an illusory person practice all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be without foundation
śāradvatī­putra just as the notion of the physical form of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha be without foundation
śāradvatī­putra just as the notion of the physical form of a tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha be without foundation

if you ask why śāradvatī­putra it be because all those phenomenon which enlightenment denote and which the meaning of the term bodhisattva denote be neither conjoin nor disjoin
they be immaterial unrevealed and unobstructed
in the same way śāradvatī­putra the meaning of the term bodhisattva as a great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non existent
that be to say their only define characteristic be that they be without define characteristic
therefore śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being should train without attachment to anything
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord if all those phenomenon which enlightenment denote and which the meaning of the term bodhisattva denote be neither conjoin nor disjoin
immaterial unrevealed and unobstructed
that be to say if their only define characteristic be that they be without define characteristic
here be some who might ask that if all those phenomenon be neither conjoin nor disjoin
if they be to ask such a question how should i respond
train in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
train in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
train in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
train in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
in the same vein how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after training in the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
similarly how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after train in the application of mindfulness
similarly how could this illusory person
after training in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
how then could this illusory person after train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom attain emancipation in omniscience
attain emancipation in omniscience
in the same vein how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after train in the ten power of the tathāgata
in the same vein how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after training in the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then how could this illusory person attain emancipation in omniscience after train in omniscient pristine cognition
if they be to ask such question venerable lord how should i respond
śāradvatī­putra to that end i will question you and you may answer as good you can
śāradvatī­putra do you think that physical form be one thing and that illusion be another
similarly do you think that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be one thing and that illusion be another
śāradvatī­putra do you think that the application of mindfulness be one thing and that illusion be another
in the same vein do you think that the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path be one thing and that illusion be another
śāradvatī­putra do you think that the ten power of the tathāgata be one thing and that illusion be another
in the same vein do you think that the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be one thing and that illusion be another do you think that emptiness be one thing and that illusion be another or that signlessness be one thing and that illusion be another or that aspirationlessness be one thing and that illusion be another
no venerable lord he reply
śāradvatī­putra do you think that enlightenment be one thing and that illusion be another
physical form be not one thing and illusion another illusion itself be physical form and physical form themselves be illusion
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not one thing and illusion another
consciousness and the other aggregate be themselves illusion and illusion itself be consciousness and the other aggregate
similarly the eye be not one thing and illusion another the eye themselves be illusion and illusion itself be the eye
similarly all the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty and in the same vein all phenomenological category up to and include feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound be not one thing and illusion another
illusion itself be feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound and feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound be themselves illusion
the other aspect of feeling up to and include feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound be not one thing and illusion another
illusion itself be feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound and feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound be themselves illusion
similarly the application of mindfulness be not one thing and illusion another
illusion be itself the application of mindfulness and application of mindfulness be themselves illusion
in the same vein all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path be not one thing and illusion another
illusion itself be the noble eightfold path and the noble eightfold path itself be illusion
similarly the ten power of the tathāgata be not one thing and illusion another

in the same vein all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be not one thing and illusion another
illusion itself be the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha themselves be illusion
the blessed one then say
in that case śāradvatī­putra do you think that there be affliction or purification with respect to that illusion
no venerable lord he reply
then śāradvatī­putra do you think that there be arise or cease with respect to that illusion
śāradvatī­putra do you think that that which be without arise ceasing affliction and purification can train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscience
or do you think that that can subsequently reach omniscience
then do this name symbol designation or term bodhisattva apply to the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate
śāradvatī­putra be that which be without name without symbol without designation without conventional expression without denomination without corporeal form without physical action without speech without verbal action without mind without mental action without arise without ceasing without affliction and without purification able to train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and then attain emancipation in omniscience
śāradvatī­putra so it be that when great-bodhisattva-being have train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without apprehend anything they will attain emancipation in omniscience
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly and seek emancipation in unsurpassed completely perfect enlightenment should always train in the manner of an illusory person
if one be to ask why venerable lord
it be so that the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate might be understand to resemble an illusory person
śāradvatī­putra do you think that these five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate can train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscience
it be because the five psycho physical aggregate have an essential nature of non entity and the essential nature of non entity be non apprehensible
śāradvatī­putra do you think that the five psycho physical aggregate can in a dreamlike manner train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscience
it be because dream have an essential nature of non entity and the essential nature of non entity be non apprehensible
śāradvatī­putra do you think that the five psycho physical aggregate can in the manner of an echo
or similarly in the manner of an optical aberration a mirage or a phantom train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscience
śāradvatī­putra do you think that these five psycho physical aggregate can train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and attain emancipation in omniscience
it be because physical form be like an illusion
and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be like an illusion
and because what be true of consciousness be also true of the six sense organ and what be true of the six sense organ be also true of the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate
venerable lord physical form be like a dream
and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be like a dream
what be true of consciousness be true of the six sense organ and what be true of the six sense organ be true of the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate
these do not apprehend the emptiness of internal phenomenon nor do they apprehend the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity

up to those who be attentive to the notion that those sense organ be the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity will all make assumption on account of these experience of emptiness
śāradvatī­putra it be in this way that bodhisattvas become unskille in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and fall into the clutch of evil associate
moreover śāradvatī­putra when unskille bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they cultivate the application of mindfulness
and apprehend those application of mindfulness
in the same vein when they cultivate the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and apprehend they
śāradvatī­putra the bodhisattvas who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner
be unskille owe to their lack of skill and they fall into the clutch of evil associate
when they hear this teaching on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they will indeed be afraid and terrified
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord how be it that bodhisattva be entice by evil associate
who be the evil associate who entice they so that they become afraid and terrified on hear this teaching on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the blessed one address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being be those who would separate and dissuade they from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and similarly those who would separate and dissuade they from the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
say o child of enlighten heritage you should not train in this
if you ask why
it be because these transcendent-perfection have not be enunciate and explain by the tathāgata arhat and completely perfect buddha
but rather they have be fabricate by poet
one should not listen to they one should not retain they
one should not comprehend they one should not recite they
one should not be attentive to they one should not demonstrate they to other
śāradvatī­putra you should know such person to be the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being include malign demonic force who be able to transform themselves into the guise of a buddha and
approach a bodhisattva say o child of enlighten heritage what will you achieve through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly what will you achieve through the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration what will you achieve through the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
what will you achieve through the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
what will you achieve through the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
what will you achieve through the transcendent-perfection of generosity
they will not disclose the action of their demonic force that seek to separate a bodhisattva from the six transcendent-perfection and they will not mention the defect of those demonic force
śāradvatī­putra you should know they to be the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra malign demonic force will transform themselves into the guise of a buddha
approach a great-bodhisattva-being and proceed to teach demonstrate analyze elucidate and completely disclose the discourse associate with the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha
as well as the other branch of their scripture up to and include the narrative and the establish instruction without mention or disclose that such form be the creation of demonic force
you should know those who do not engage in genuine realization to be the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being
say o child of enlighten heritage you be not a bodhisattva
you lack the mind set on enlightenment
you be not on the irreversible level
you can not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
o child of enlighten heritage the eye be empty of notion of i and mine
o child of enlighten heritage the ear nose tongue body and mental faculty be similarly empty of notion of i and mine
o child of enlighten heritage in the same vein the other phenomenon up to and include feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound be empty of notion of i and mine
and all those up to and include feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound be empty of notion of i and mine
similarly the transcendent-perfection of generosity be empty
and all those up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be empty of notion of i and mine
similarly the application of mindfulness be empty
and the other causal attribute from there up to and include the noble eightfold path and up to the three gateway to liberation be all empty of notion of i and mine
similarly the fruitional attribute from the ten power of the tathāgata up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be empty of notion of i and mine
so what will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
so what will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
so what will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they will not mention or disclose that such form be the creation of demonic force
you should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra malign demonic force will transform themselves into the guise of a pratyekabuddha and approach a great-bodhisattva-being
say o child of enlighten heritage the eastern direction be empty of lord buddhas bodhisattvas and śrāvaka
in it there be no lord buddhas no bodhisattvas and no śrāvaka
indeed all the world system of the ten direction be similar to the eastern direction
moreover śāradvatī­putra malign demonic force will transform themselves into the guise of a śrāvaka and approach a great-bodhisattva-being
oppose the attention endow with omniscience and promote the twofold over scrupulous attentiveness associate with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha
they will not mention or disclose such form to be the creation of demonic force
you should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra demonic force will transform themselves into the guise of a monastic preceptor or an authentic master and approach great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra demonic force will transform themselves into the guise of a monastic preceptor or an authentic master and approach great-bodhisattva-being
encourage they to undertake training divorce from the conduct of the bodhisattvas
separate they from the attention endow with omniscience
separate they from the application of mindfulness and in the same vein
separate they from the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and separate they from emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
say o child of enlighten heritage if you cultivate these attribute you will actualize the level of the śrāvaka
what will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
moreover śāradvatī­putra demonic force will transform themselves into an invisible guise
and approach great-bodhisattva-being say o child of enlighten heritage come
to what end do you roam in cyclic existence for innumerable countless eon
experience the unfathomable suffering of amputation of the hand and foot and decapitation
what will you achieve through this manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
you should persevere in those teaching which actualize the fruit of enter the stream
moreover śāradvatī­putra demonic force will transform themselves into the guise of a fully ordain monk
teach in an apprehending manner the doctrine that the eye be impermanent
that they be not a self that they be empty that they be signless that they be without aspiration that they be calm
they will teach in an apprehending manner the doctrine that the eye
that they be void that they be purify that they be non arising that they be uncease and that they be non entity
be imbue with suffer
this apply extensively also to the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty just as it apply to the eye
similarly they will teach in an apprehending manner that the application of mindfulness be impermanent
in the same vein they will teach in an apprehending manner that all the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be so
and similarly they will teach in an apprehending manner that the ten power of the tathāgata be impermanent
they will not mention or disclose such form to be the creation of demonic force
you should know those who do not entertain genuine realization to be the evil associate of great-bodhisattva-being
then having understand the nature of evil associate you should abandon they
thereupon senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord what skill in mean do great-bodhisattva-being possess when
they be accept by genuine spiritual mentor and abandon evil associate
the blessed one reply
similarly when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view of sentient being
or their view of living creature their view of living organism their view of life
their view of individual or their view of humankind human being
agent actor petitioner
instigator experiencer experience subject
knower and viewer
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view of self and
and similarly
their view of existence their view of non existence their view of the psycho physical aggregate their view of the sensory element
their view of the sense field their view of the four truth and their view of dependent origination
in order that they might abandon
they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
their view of the application of mindfulness
and in the same vein their view of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view of the ten power of the tathāgata
and in the same vein when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and similarly when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view of sentient being to be mature their view of field to be refine their view of enlightenment their view of the buddha and their view concern the promulgation of the doctrinal wheel
in all these case śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being have be accept by genuine spiritual mentor and have abandon evil associate
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view of self
and in the same vein when they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon their view up to and include their view concern the promulgation of the doctrinal wheel
in all these case they teach the sacred doctrine without apprehend anything
it be in this way śāradvatī­putra that great-bodhisattva-being have be accept by spiritual mentor who be skilled in mean and have abandon evil associate
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord when great-bodhisattva-being teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in order that they might abandon all sort of view
why o lord would great-bodhisattva-being have a view concern physical form
similarly why would they have a view concern feeling a view concern perception a view concern formative predisposition a view concern consciousness
and similarly why would they have a view concern the eye and in the same vein why would they have a view concern the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
and similarly why would they have a view concern sight and in the same vein to what end would they have a view concern the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon
and similarly why would they have a view concern the sensory element of the eye and in the same vein why would they have a view concern the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness
and similarly why would they have a view concern the sensory element of sight and in the same vein why would they have a view concern other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental phenomenon

similarly why would they have a view concern the ten power of the tathāgata and in the same vein why would they have a view concern the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then the blessed one address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who be unskille in practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom apprehend physical form and develop a view of physical form in an apprehending manner
similarly they apprehend feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and develop a view of they in an apprehending manner
similarly they apprehend the eye and develop a view of the eye in an apprehending manner
and in the same vein they apprehend the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty and develop a view of they in an apprehending manner

for these reason śāradvatī­putra bodhisattva who be unskille have a view concern physical form
similarly they have a view concern feeling a view concern perception a view concern formative predisposition and a view concern consciousness
similarly they have a view concern the eye and in the same vein they have a view concern the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
similarly they have a view concern sight
and in the same vein they have a view concern the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon

similarly they have a view concern the ten power of the tathāgata and in the same vein they have a view concern the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
in order that these view might be abandon great-bodhisattva-being who be adroit and skilled in practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being without apprehend anything
then senior śāradvatī­putra say to the blessed one
venerable lord i be inspire to say in what sense bodhisattva be call great being
the blessed one ask śāradvatī­putra be you inspire to say that
yes venerable lord he reply i be inspire to say that
well then how be it
venerable lord the enlighten mind of the bodhisattvas be equal to the unequaled
and it be not share in common with any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
in that sense a bodhisattva be call a great being
then the blessed one address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
it be because they be even unattached to the mind endow with omniscience which be uncontaminated and not include within the three world system
śāradvatī­putra what be the mind of great-bodhisattva-being which be equal to the unequaled
and which be not share in common with any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
then senior śāradvatī­putra reply to the blessed one
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
do not consider anything at all that arise or cease
there be nothing at all that decrease or increase
there be nothing at all that be afflict or purify
venerable lord that which neither arise nor cease
which neither decrease nor increase
which be neither afflict nor purify
and which be neither identify with the mindset of the śrāvakas nor with the mindset of the pratyekabuddha
nor yet with the mind of the completely perfect buddha be the mind of great-bodhisattva-being equal to the unequaled and not share in common with any śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
śāradvatī­putra it be as you have say this mind of the bodhisattvas be indeed unattached to the level of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha
venerable lord in that case be this mind of the bodhisattvas unattache to physical form

then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
you have say venerable lord that that mind which be omniscient be not include within the three world system since it be without contaminant
in that case venerable lord be the mind of all ordinary person also free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
similarly be the mind of all śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha and those of all the tathāgata free from contaminant and not include within the three world system
śāradvatī­putra he reply that be so
venerable lord be physical form also free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
similarly be feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
venerable lord be the eye also free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence

and in the same vein be the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
śāradvatī­putra he reply it be just as you have say

similarly the mind of all śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha be free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
similarly physical form be also free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
similarly the eye be also free from contaminant and not include within the three world system owe to the emptiness of inherent existence
and the same go for the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty

then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
the venerable lord have say that
great-bodhisattva-being be unattached to this mind because there be no mind
in that case
venerable lord be non existent physical form unattache to non existent physical form
and in the same vein be the other non existent aggregate up to and include non existent consciousness unattached to non existent consciousness and the rest
venerable lord be non existent eye unattached to non existent eye
and in the same vein be the other non existent sense organ up to and include the non existent mental faculty unattache to the non existent mental faculty and the rest
venerable lord be non existent sight unattache to non existent sight
similarly be the other non existent sense object up to and include non existent mental phenomenon unattache to non existent mental phenomenon and the rest
enerable lord be the non existent sensory element of the eye unattached to the non existent sensory element of the eye

śāradvatī­putra he reply it be just as you have say
non existent physical form remain unattached to non existent physical form and the same go for the other non existent aggregate up to and include consciousness
the same go for the eye and the other non existent sense organ up to and include the mental faculty the same go for sight and the other non existent sense object up to and include mental phenomenon

similarly the non existent ten power of the tathāgata remain unattached to the non existent ten power of the tathāgata
and the same go for the other non existent fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly have mind that be equal to the unequaled and that be not share in common with the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha
no venerable lord
because this mind of the bodhisattvas be non perceptual it do not make assumption and it do not become fixated
this complete the seventh chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle non apprehension
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do unskille great-bodhisattva-being descend to the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
and how do they not enter into the maturity of a bodhisattva
what be the immaturity of a bodhisattva what be the maturity of a bodhisattva
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra the immaturity of a bodhisattva manifest when great-bodhisattva-being who have previously regress descend to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha and fail to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the immaturity of a great-bodhisattva-being who have previously regress
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who be unskille practice the six transcendent-perfection
owe to their lack of skill in mean they actualize the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha dependent on the three gateway to liberation emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
and they do not maintain the maturity of the bodhisattvas
that śāradvatī­putra be the immaturity of a great-bodhisattva-being who have previously regress
venerable lord why do this immaturity of great-bodhisattva-being occur
śāradvatī­putra this immaturity entail craving for the sacred doctrine
he ask venerable lord what be the immaturity that crave for the sacred doctrine
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that physical form be impermanent
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be impermanent
this craving for the sacred doctrine in the case of great-bodhisattva-being be indicative of their immaturity
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be not a self
establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be imbue with suffering
when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be empty
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be signless
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be without aspiration
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be calm
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be void
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness be purify
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness do not arise
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the aggregate from physical form to consciousness do not cease
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that physical form be non entity
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the other aggregate up to and include consciousness be non entity
in all such case śāradvatī­putra this craving for the sacred doctrine in the case of great-bodhisattva-being indicate their immaturity
śāradvatī­putra it be in this way that unskille great-bodhisattva-being have formerly regress
descend to the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha and fail to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be impermanent owe to their lack of skill in mean
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be imbue with suffering
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be not a self
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be empty
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be signless
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be without aspiration
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be calm
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be void
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be purify
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be non arise
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the sensory element from the eye to mental phenomenon be uncease
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the eye be non entity
and similarly when they establish cognize and become fixate on the notion that the other sensory element up to and include mental phenomenon be non entity
in all such case śāradvatī­putra this craving for the sacred doctrine in the case of great-bodhisattva-being indicate their immaturity
śāradvatī­putra it be in this way that unskille great-bodhisattva-being have formerly regress
descend to the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha and fail to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom owe to their lack of skill in mean
the same refrain should be extensively apply to all the sensory element and all the causal attribute from the application of mindfulness up to and include the noble eightfold path
and likewise to all the fruitional attribute from the ten power of the tathāgata up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha just as have be indicate here in the context of the psycho physical aggregate
śāradvatī­putra it be in that way that unskille great-bodhisattva-being have formerly regress
descend to the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha and fail to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
śāradvatī­putra you also ask what be the maturity of a great-bodhisattva-being in this regard
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should train as follow they should not in any respect make assumption on account of physical form
they should not make assumption on account of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they should not make assumption on account of the eye and similarly they should not make assumption on account of the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty
they should not make assumption on account of sight and similarly they should not make assumption on account of sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
they should not make asumption on account of the sensory element of the eye they should not make assumption on account of the sensory element of sight they should not make assumption on account of the sensory element of visual consciousness
and in the same vein they should not make assumption on account of all the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness
they should not make assumption on account of the transcendent-perfection of generosity similarly they should not make assumption on account of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they should not make assumption on account of the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless meditative absorption they should not make assumption on account of the application of mindfulness
and in the same vein they should not make assumption on account of all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
likewise they should not make assumption on account of the ten power of the tathāgata
and in the same vein they should not make assumption on account of all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
should not make assumption even on account of the enlighten mind the mind that be equal to the unequaled the uncommon mind the mind of vast extent
if you ask why it be because the intrinsic nature of this mind be luminosity
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord what be the nature of luminosity the intrinsic nature of mind
the blessed one reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
neither have hatred nor be it without hatred
it neither have delusion nor be it without delusion
similarly it neither have obsession fetter or latent impulse nor be it without they
similarly it neither have all the fetter of philosophical view nor be it without they
it neither have the mindset of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha nor be it without they
this śāradvatī­putra be the natural luminosity of the mind with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow
senior śāradvatī­putra then ask as follow
lord do this mind that be not the mind exist
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra do this nature of mind with which mind be endow exist or not exist do it have be or non be in term of apprehensibility be it in fact apprehensible
he reply venerable lord that be not the case
the lord buddha then say śāradvatī­putra if the nature of mind with which mind be endow have neither existence nor non existence and if it be non apprehensible
then śāradvatī­putra surely your question do this mind that be not the mind exist be contestable how can this reasoning be correct
senior śāradvatī­putra then ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the nature of mind with which mind be endow
he reply śāradvatī­putra that which be unchanging and without conceptual notion regard all thing be call the nature of mind with which mind be endow
venerable lord just as there be no change and no conceptual notion regard the actual mind
then be there no change and no conceptual notion regard actual physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein be there no change and no conceptual notion regard any phenomena at all up to and include all formative predisposition
if that be the case there would be no change and no conceptual notion regard all attribute and attainment up to and include enlightenment
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra that be right
there be no change and no conceptual notion regard any mind
there be no change and there be no conceptual notion regard any phenomena up to and include all formative predisposition
and similarly regard all the attribute and attainment up to and include enlightenment
śāradvatī­putra the mind neither have desire nor be it without desire
śāradvatī­putra this absence of change and absence of conceptual notion regard all thing be designate as the maturity of a great bodhisattva be who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover śāradvatī­putra the maturity of a great bodhisattva be also entail the four application of mindfulness which be correctly retain by skill in mean
if you ask what these four be
they may be describe as follow   great-bodhisattva-being who be diligent alert and mindful after eliminate worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehend anything
with regard to the inner body continue to observe the physical body without generate any apperception dependent on the physical body
similarly those who be diligent alert and mindful after eliminate worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehend anything
with regard to the inner and outer body combine continue to observe the physical body without generate any apperception dependent on the physical body
with regard to the outer body continue to observe the physical body without generate any apperception dependent on the physical body
those who be diligent alert and mindful after eliminate worldly covetousness and sadness without apprehend anything
with regard to inner feeling outer feeling and combine inner and outer feeling continue to observe feeling without generate any apperception dependent on feeling
with regard to the inner mind the outer mind and the combine inner and outer mind continue to observe the mind without generate any apperception dependent on the mind

consider that their body comprise the element of earth the element of water the element of fire and the element of wind
śāradvatī­putra just as a skilled butcher of bull or the skilled apprentice of a butcher of bull

flesh ligament bone marrow kidney
heart spleen lung liver stomach
intestine sigmoid colon genital urinary bladder excrement
tear sweat adipose tissue
saliva nasal mucous pus
serum odor urine brain tissue and cerebral secretion
śāradvatī­putra this be just as when the grain bin of a householder farmer have be place on either side of his doorway fill with diverse grain
sesame husk rice bean kidney bean barley
wheat lentil unhuske rice other grain such as millet and mustard
and an observant passer by on see they
would know that these be sesame these be husk rice these be bean these be kidney bean these be barley these be wheat these be lentil these be unhuske rice these be other grain such as millet and these be mustard

then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
proceed on the path to enlightenment and how indeed do they enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
can they not be overcome by anyone
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not make assumption about the aggregate of physical form
similarly they do not make assumption about the other aggregate up to and include the aggregate of consciousness
they do not make assumption about the sense field of the eye
and similarly they do not make assumption about the other sense field up to and include the sense field of the mental faculty
they do not make assumption about the sense field of sight and they do not make assumption about the other sense field start from there and continue up to the sense field of mental phenomenon
similarly they do not make assumption about the sensory element of the eye
they do not make assumption about the sensory element of sight and they do not make assumption about the sensory element of visual consciousness
and in the same vein they do not make assumption about the sensory element of the mental faculty
and they do not make assumption about the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental phenomenon
they do not make assumption about the application of mindfulness and they do not make assumption about the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
as many god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm as there be throughout the world system of the great trichiliocosm all congregate there in that same assembly along with their divine prince ten million one hundred billion many hundred thousand in number
the divine prince of the tuṣita realm
the divine prince of the yāma realm
the divine prince of the nirmāṇa­rata realm and
the divine prince of the para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm
all the god preside over the pure abodes as many as there be throughout the world system of the great trichiliocosm also congregate there in that same assembly along with the less god of the pure abodes ten million one hundred billion many hundred thousand in number
throughout the world system of the great trichiliocosm also congregate there in that same assembly as do all the god preside over the twelve brahmā realm as many as there be in the world system of the great trichiliocosm along with the less god of the brahmā realm ten million one hundred billion many hundred thousand in number
nor do they approach it in any number fraction synonym comparison or quality
they do not approach even a thousandth part of it they do not approach one hundred thousandth part nor one thousand billionth part of it
yet the radiance of their body originate through the ripening of the past action of the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm
and similarly the radiance of their body originate through the ripening of the past action of the god of the trayas­triṃśa yāma tuṣita nirmāṇa­rata and para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm
and likewise that of the other god from those of the brahmākāyika realm up to the pure abodes do not approach even one hundredth part of the natural radiance of the tathā­gata
the effulgence of the tathā­gata ’s body be manifestly supreme alongside those radiance
it be manifestly perfect supreme abundant unsurpassed and unexcelle
just as a burn tree stump neither shine nor gleam nor sparkle alongside the gold of the jambu river
so the radiance of all the god originate through the ripening of their past action neither shone nor gleam nor sparkle alongside the natural effulgence of the tathā­gata ’s body
indeed alongside those radiance the natural effulgence of the tathā­gata ’s body be good
it be perfect supreme abundant unsurpassed and unexcelle
then śakra mighty lord of the god address senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable su­bhūti we as many god as we be in these world system of the great trichiliocosm
extend from the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm as far as the pure abodes have congregate here in this assembly to hear the sacred doctrine in the presence of senior su­bhūti
extend from the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm as far as the pure abodes have congregate here
in this assembly to hear the sacred doctrine in the presence of senior su­bhūti
inasmuch as we also wish to hear this very teaching on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
how should great-bodhisattva-being train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
what be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow
how should great-bodhisattva-being train
senior su­bhūti then reply to śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika you should listen carefully and keep this in mind
through the power of the buddha and through the blessing of the buddha
i shall explain to you the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow as well as how they should train and how they should practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
those divine prince who have not yet cultivate their thought in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should do so now
if you ask why
however those who have already arrive at the maturity of the finality of existence will not be able to set their mind upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
it be because they will have put an end to cyclic existence
however if they do set their mind upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
i will not impede their virtuous approach indeed i will rejoice in it
they should nonetheless focus on the most distinguished doctrine among the most distinguished doctrine
kauśika in this regard what one might ask be this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
kauśika great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience should be attentive to the notion that physical form be impermanent
similarly they should be attentive to the notion that physical form be imbue with suffering without a self prone to ill health prone to pustule prone to sharp pain prone to harm prone to decay alien disturbed brittle fearful prone to contagion empty unreliable and calamitous
however they should do so without apprehend anything
similarly they should be attentive to the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be impermanent and so on up to calamitous
likewise they should be attentive to the notion that the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty be impermanent
and they should also be attentive to the other notion up to and include the notion that these be calamitous
similarly they should be attentive to the notion that the earth element the water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the consciousness element be impermanent
and they should also be attentive to the other notion up to and include the notion that these be extremely calamitous
similarly they should be attentive to the notion that physical form be calm and void
however they should do so without apprehend anything
similarly they should be attentive to the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be calm and void
similarly they should be attentive to the notion that the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body the mental faculty and
likewise the earth element the water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the consciousness element be calm and void
similarly those bodhisattvas who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience should be attentive to the formative predisposition that be condition by fundamental ignorance
then through the reversal of dependent origination they should be attentive to the cessation of the entire great mass of suffering
thereafter through the unfolding of the link of dependent origination they should be attentive to the origination of the entire great mass of suffering
moreover kauśika those great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience should meditate on the application of mindfulness
in the same vein they should meditate on the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and
similarly on the ten power of the tathāgata
the four assurance
the four unhindered discernment
great loving kindness
great compassion and
the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
moreover kauśika those great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience should practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly they should practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
however they should do so without apprehend anything
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
likewise the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and
however they should do so without apprehend anything
moreover kauśika when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they purify master perfect augment and construe phenomenon simply on the basis of phenomenon
they discern that the concept of i and mine be utterly non existent
thought of dedication possess by great-bodhisattva-being be not associate with the enlighten mind
the mind set on enlightenment be not associate with thought of dedication
kauśika thought of dedication be not discern and be non apprehensible in the mind that be set on enlightenment
the mind set on enlightenment be not discern and be non apprehensible in thought of dedication
indeed kauśika all the attribute of great-bodhisattva-being should be correctly discern in that manner just as they be
this be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which do not objectify anything
then śakra mighty lord of the god say to senior su­bhūti
venerable su­bhūti in what way be thought of dedication not associate with the mind set on enlightenment
in what way be the mind set on enlightenment not associate with thought of dedication
in what way be thought of dedication indiscernible and non apprehensible in the mind that be set on enlightenment
in what way be the mind set on enlightenment indiscernible and non apprehensible in thought of dedication
senior su­bhūti then reply to śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika thought of dedication be non mind
the mind set on enlightenment be non mind
non mind do not dedicate merit to non mind
nor do inconceivability dedicate merit to the inconceivable
if you ask why
it be because the nature of mind be itself non mind and inconceivability be non mind
kauśika this be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow
they do not make assumption about the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and they do not make assumption about the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they do not make assumption about the ten power of the tathāgata
and likewise they do not make assumption about the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly they do not make assumption about their attainment up to and include the fruit of having enter the stream
and they do not make assumption about their other attainment up to and include arhatship
similarly they do not make assumption about individual enlightenment or about unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being flourish accordingly through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will proceed on the path to enlightenment and they will also enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas they can not be overcome by anyone
moreover śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being who abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and then perfect the pristine cognition of omniscience be endow with that cognition
they will never fall into the low realm of existence and
they will never be belittle among human being they will never become impoverished and if they do possess a corporeal form they will not acquire a body that be censure by the world of human god and antigod
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being be endow with the cognition whereby they would never regress into the low realm of existence and never be censure by the world of god human and antigod what be that cognition
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being be endow with that cognition
in the world system of the eastern direction which be as numerous as the sand of the river ganges
they will perceive tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha as numerous as the sand of the river ganges
and they will listen to the sacred teaching from they
they will also perceive the community of the śrāvaka and the community of the bodhisattvas who be associate with those lord buddhas
and they will also perceive the array of the enlighten attribute of the buddhafield
if great-bodhisattva-being be endow with that cognition
they do not maintain notion regard the buddha they do not maintain notion regard the bodhisattvas they do not maintain notion regard the śrāvaka they have no notion regard the pratyekabuddha
they have no notion regard self they have no notion regard non self and they have no notion regard the buddhafield
they do practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity but they do not apprehend that generosity and then they also practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but they do not apprehend that transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if they be endow with such cognition
they practice the application of mindfulness without apprehend the application of mindfulness
in the same vein they practice the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha without apprehend the distinct quality of the buddha
they bring all phenomena to perfection and they be aware that they do not make assumption about all these phenomenon
so it be śāradvatī­putra that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom who wish to pursue the path to enlightenment and who wish to enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
should have no opportunity to indulge in physical verbal and mental action that be taint with the inadmissible transgression
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the physical action that be taint with the inadmissible transgression which great-bodhisattva-being might have
śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being be endow with that cognition
what be the correspond verbal action and what be the correspond mental action
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being think
this be the body on the basis of which the self be to be apprehend as the body
or similarly this be the speech on the basis of which the self be to be apprehend as speech
or this be the mind on the basis of which the self be to be apprehend as the mind
śāradvatī­putra all that denote physical action verbal action and mental action that be taint with the inadmissible transgression
however śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not at all apprehend the physical body and so forth
consequently the venerable lord when he be formerly a bodhisattva
train in the six transcendent-perfection and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
venerable lord in that same way we too should cause great-bodhisattva-being to delight in the six transcendent-perfection
kauśika you should listen carefully and keep this in mind
i will explain how great-bodhisattva-being should abide in and how they should practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
senior su­bhūti then say to śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika physical form be empty of physical form
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of consciousness and the other aggregate
the bodhisattva be empty of the bodhisattvas
kauśika in this regard the emptiness of physical form be indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they can not be bisect
similarly the emptiness of feeling the emptiness of perception the emptiness of formative predisposition and the emptiness of consciousness be indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they can not be bisect
kauśika great-bodhisattva-being should train accordingly in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover kauśika the eye be empty of the eye and in the same vein the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty be empty of the mental faculty and so forth
thus the emptiness of the eye and the emptiness of the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty be indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they can not be bisect
in the same vein as before
the earth element be empty of the earth element
similarly the earth element the fire element the wind element the space element and the consciousness element be empty of the consciousness element and the rest
śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be to apprehend the physical body
and in do so be to generate through their body speech or mind thought of miserliness
and if they be to generate thought of degenerate morality
thought of agitation thought of indolence thought of distraction or thought of stupidity then
we should arouse they
we should incite they and establish they therein
we should cause they to delight in the six transcendent-perfection
delighted induce arouse incited and establish by we in the six transcendent-perfection they in turn will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
thus the emptiness of the earth element and the emptiness of the other element up to and include the consciousness element be indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they can not be bisect
kauśika great-bodhisattva-being should train accordingly in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover kauśika fundamental ignorance be empty of fundamental ignorance similarly the other link of dependent origination up to and include aging and death be empty of age and death and the rest
similarly the cessation of fundamental ignorance be empty of the cessation of fundamental ignorance and the cessation of the other link of dependent origination up to and include aging and death be empty of the cessation of aging and death and the rest
thus the emptiness of the cessation of fundamental ignorance and the emptiness of the cessation of the other link of dependent origination up to and include aging and death be indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they can not be bisect
similarly in the same vein as before
this refrain should be apply also to the transcendent-perfection of generosity and it should also be apply to the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly this refrain should also be apply to the eighteen aspect of emptiness start from the emptiness of internal phenomenon and continue up to the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly this refrain should be apply to the causal attribute start from the application of mindfulness and continue up to the noble eightfold path
similarly it should be apply to all the meditative stability
similarly too this refrain should be apply to the fruitional attribute start from the ten power of the tathāgata and continue up to the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and to all the gateway of mnemonic incantation
similarly it should also be apply to the vehicle of the śrāvaka
it should also be apply to the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha
and indeed it should be apply to the vehicle of the bodhisattvas and to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
moreover kauśika omniscience be empty of omniscience the bodhisattva be empty of the bodhisattvas
thus the emptiness of omniscience be indivisible with this emptiness of the bodhisattvas and they can not be bisect
kauśika great-bodhisattva-being should abide accordingly in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then śakra mighty lord of the god address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti in what way do great-bodhisattva-being dwell in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
kauśika in this regard great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not dwell on physical form
similarly they should not dwell on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly they should not dwell on the eye and they should not dwell on the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
they should not dwell on feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound and they should not dwell on the other aspect of feeling up to and include feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound
similarly they should not dwell on the earth element and they should not dwell on the other element up to and include the consciousness element
similarly they should not dwell on the application of mindfulness and they should not dwell on the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience
similarly they should not dwell on the fruit of enter the stream and they should not dwell on the other fruit of spiritual attainment up to and include arhatship
they should not dwell on the individual enlightenment of the pratyekabuddha and they should not dwell on the other level of attainment up to and include genuinely perfect enlightenment
so it be that they should not dwell on physical form and they should not dwell on anything at all up to and include genuinely perfect buddhahood
moreover kauśika they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be permanent
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be impermanent
in the same vein they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be imbue with happiness
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be imbue with suffering
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be a self nor should they dwell on the notion that these be not a self
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be empty nor should they dwell on the notion that they be not empty
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be with sign nor should they dwell on the notion that they be signless
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form have aspiration nor should they dwell on the notion that they be without aspiration
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be calm nor should they dwell on the notion that they be not calm
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be void nor should they dwell on the notion that they be not void
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form arise
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form cease
they should not dwell on the notion that physical form be entity nor should they dwell on the notion that they be not entity
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be permanent nor should they dwell on the notion that they be impermanent
in the same vein
they should not dwell on all those other notion up to and include the notion that these aggregate be entity or that they be non entity
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that the fruit of enter the stream be well distinguish by condition phenomenon nor should they dwell on the notion that this fruit be well distinguish by unconditioned phenomenon
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that the individual enlightenment of the pratyekabuddha and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be well distinguish by condition phenomenon nor should they dwell on the notion that these be well distinguish by unconditioned phenomenon
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that the fruit of be tie to one further rebirth
the fruit of be no long subject to rebirth and
the fruit of arhatship be well distinguish by condition phenomenon nor should they dwell on the notion that these fruit be well distinguish by unconditioned phenomenon
moreover kauśika they should not dwell on the notion that those who have enter the stream be worthy of gift
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that those who be tie to one further rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth or those who be arhat pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas and tathāgata be worthy of gift
so it be kauśika great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not dwell in that manner
moreover kauśika great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not dwell on the first bodhisattva level
in the same vein
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the other bodhisattva level up to and include the tenth level
if you ask why it be because if they be to dwell thereon they would vacillate
moreover they should not dwell on the notion that i having first begin to set my mind on enlightenment should perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i should perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i having first begin to set my mind on enlightenment should cultivate the application of mindfulness
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the other notion pertain to the causal attribute up to and include the notion that i should cultivate the noble eightfold path
similarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i should cultivate ten power of the tathāgata
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the other notion pertain to the fruitional attribute up to and include the notion that i should cultivate the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i should enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i as a great-bodhisattva-being should subsequently reach the irreversible level
similarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i as a great-bodhisattva-being should perfect the five extrasensory power of a bodhisattva
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i as a great-bodhisattva-being abide in these five extrasensory power of a bodhisattva
should proceed to the innumerable countless buddhafield in order to pay homage to make offering to venerate and listen to the sacred doctrine in the presence of the lord buddhas
or that i as a great-bodhisattva-being having indeed hear this sacred doctrine should emanate similar field to those field of the buddha
so it be that they should not dwell in an apprehending manner in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they should not even dwell on the notion that i having travel through innumerable countless world system
i should esteem they worship they and make offering to they
should venerate the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha with flower garland perfume unguent parasol victory banner and cotton robe thousand of billion in number
nor should they dwell on the notion that i having travel there should establish innumerable countless sentient being in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i should cultivate the five eye which you may ask comprise the eye of flesh the eye of divine clairvoyance the eye of the sacred doctrine the eye of wisdom and the eye of the buddha
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i should persevere in whichever meditative stability be desire
they should not dwell on the notion that i should attain all the gateway of mnemonic incantation
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i should attain the ten power of the tathāgata
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i should attain the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i should attain the body of a superior man endow with the thirty two major mark
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i should attain a body endow with the eighty minor mark
similarly they should not dwell on the status of one who rank among the eight kind of realize individual
that be to say they should not dwell on the notion that i be a follower on account of faith or i be a follower on account of the doctrine
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that as i maintain the level of one who have enter the stream i will become one who will be reborn only seven more time
they should not dwell on the notion that i will be reborn within an identical class of god or human over successive life or as one with only a single far intervene rebirth
they should not dwell on the notion that i be an individual on a par with those whose series of life have end and whose afflict mental state have end
they should not dwell on the notion that i be one who have enter the stream possess the attribute of non regression
they should not dwell on the notion that i having enter this world for the last time as one tie to one more rebirth will bring suffering to an end
they should not dwell on the notion that i as one who be no long subject to rebirth will attain final nirvāṇa in this life
they should not dwell on the notion that i be an arhat whose contaminant have cease
be one who will not be reborn and i will attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psycho physical aggregate be leave behind
they should not dwell on the notion that i be a pratyekabuddha
they should not dwell on the notion that i be a genuinely perfect buddha
they should not dwell on the notion that i should transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha and abide on the level of the bodhisattvas
similarly they should not dwell on the pristine cognition which be the understanding of the aspect of the path
they should not in an apprehending manner dwell on the notion that i having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all thing and in all way should renounce all afflict mental state and involuntary reincarnation through propensity
they should not dwell on the notion that i having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and become a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha should turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
similarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i having enact the deed of the buddha should bring innumerable countless sentient being to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psycho physical aggregate be leave behind
similarly they should not dwell on the notion that i abide utterly in the meditation of the four support for miraculous ability when enter meditative stability should be absorb in such meditative stability that would enable i to remain for eon as numerous as the sand of the river ganges
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that the limit of my lifespan be inestimable
similarly they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion that i should possess the thirty two major mark of a superior man and consummate each of these mark of a superior man with one hundred merit
they should not dwell on the notion that my buddhafield should equal in its extent the world system as many as the sand of the river ganges throughout the cardinal direction east south west and north
they should not dwell on the notion may the world system of this my great trichiliocosm be fashion of indestructible reality
they should not dwell in an apprehending manner on the notion may the desire hatred and delusion of those sentient being who have scent the fragrance of my tree of enlightenment be eliminate
and without cultivate the mindset of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha may those sentient being by scent that fragrance exclusively ascertain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
may they experience such fragrance that give rise neither to physical ailment nor to imbalance of wind
they should not even dwell on the notion in this my buddhafield may the term physical form not exist and similarly may the term feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness not exist
they should not even dwell on the notion in this my buddhafield may the term transcendent-perfection of generosity exist and similarly may the term indicative of the other transcendent-perfection start from the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom exclusively exist
similarly they should not even dwell on the notion in this my buddhafield may the term application of mindfulness exist
similarly they should not dwell on the notion in this my buddhafield may the term indicative of the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha ever exist
they should not dwell on the notion in this my buddhafield may the term indicative of those who enter the stream never exist and may the term indicative of arhat and pratyekabuddha never exist
they should not even dwell on the notion in this my buddhafield may the term bodhisattva and the term buddha exclusively exist
if you ask why this be so
at this point the full refrain should be extensively apply exactly as indicate above in the middle of this chapter
it be because once the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment all thing be unapprehended
kauśika great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner should not dwell on anything at all
then senior su­bhūti know in his own mind the thought of senior śāradvatī­putra address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra on what do you think the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha dwell
senior śāradvatī­putra reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti the tathāgata do not dwell on anything at all
even the mind of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha do not dwell on anything at all
it do not dwell on physical form
it do not dwell on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
it do not dwell on condition element
it do not dwell on the causal and fruitional attribute from the application of mindfulness up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
it do not dwell on omniscience
śāradvatī­putra just as the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha the lord and teacher neither dwell nor do they not dwell
so great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should dwell with respect to all thing
then there be some divine prince among the assembly who think
we can understand the word and speech of the yakṣas the expression of the yakṣas the language of the yakṣas and the meaning of the yakṣas when utter by the yakṣas
and yet we do not understand these explanation statement teaching interpretation elucidation instruction and expression of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which senior su­bhūti have just give
then senior su­bhūti know in his own mind the thought of these divine prince address they as follow
divine prince can you not understand the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they reply
indeed venerable su­bhūti we can not understand the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then senior su­bhūti address these divine prince as follow
o divine prince not a single syllable have be utter or disclose for you to hear
if you ask why
divine prince it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not consist of syllable
and there be no listener who would hear it
if you ask why
divine prince it be because there be no syllable in the enlightenment of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
divine prince if for example the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be to emanate a buddha and that buddha too be to conjure forth emanation
emanate an assembly of fully ordain monk an assembly of fully ordain nun an assembly of layman and an assembly of laywoman and
if having emanate these he be to teach the sacred doctrine to these four assembly what do you think divine prince would any doctrine be reveal by any sentient be to those assembly
would any doctrine be hear or cognize by any sentient being
su­bhūti then say
divine prince it be so
all doctrine be like phantom
they be not explain by anyone
they be not hear by any sentient being and indeed they be not know by anyone at all
divine prince if for example one be to see in a dream a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha teach the sacred doctrine
what do you think divine prince
would anything be explain hear or cognize by anyone
it would not venerable su­bhūti they answer
all doctrine be like dream
they be not explain hear or cognize by anyone at all
divine prince if for example two people stand in the defile of a ravine be to praise the buddha
and likewise praise the dharma and the saṅgha
and if two echo be to reverberate from the sound of the word of those two people
would the first echo hear or cognize the second echo
the full refrain should be apply exactly as before in the case of phantom and dream
divine prince if for example
an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist stand at a major crossroad
be to conjure a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
and this very phantom of the tathāgata be to teach the sacred doctrine to four phantom assembly
what do you think divine prince
would any doctrine be reveal by any sentient be
indeed would anything be hear or cognize by any sentient be
it would not venerable su­bhūti they answer
here again the same refrain should be apply exactly as before
then these divine prince think
may this eld su­bhūti elucidate this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
may he explain the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom most profoundly
may he demonstrate it most subtly
senior su­bhūti discern with his own mind the thought of these divine prince then address they as follow
divine prince physical form be neither profound nor subtle
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither profound nor subtle
the essential nature of physical form be neither profound nor subtle
similarly the essential nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither profound nor subtle
in the same vein as before
the full refrain should also be apply to the eye exactly as indicate in the context of the psycho physical aggregate and it should also be apply to to the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
similarly it should be apply to visual consciousness and it should also be apply to the other mode of sensory consciousness up to and include mental consciousness
similarly it should be apply to the transcendent-perfection of generosity and it should also be apply to the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly it should be apply to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and it should also be apply to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly it should be apply to the application of mindfulness and it should also be apply to the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
it should be apply to the ten power of the tathāgata and it should also be apply to the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly it should be apply to all the meditative stability and also to all the gateway of mnemonic incantation
similarly omniscience be neither profound nor subtle
similarly the essential nature of omniscience be neither profound nor subtle
then these divine prince think
in this teaching of the sacred doctrine be there no imputation of physical form
be there no imputation of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
be there no imputation of the transcendent-perfection of generosity and of the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
śāradvatī­putra one should know that they would not be great-bodhisattva-being
śāradvatī­putra if great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
hey will purify the negativity of body and if they also purify the negativity of speech and purify the negativity of mind
it follow that those great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will refine the path to enlightenment and correctly enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being purify the negativity of body
similarly how do they purify the negativity of speech and mind
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra whenever great-bodhisattva-being do not apprehend the physical body
and do not apprehend speech and mind
then śāradvatī­putra these great-bodhisattva-being continue to pursue the path associate with the ten virtuous action from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
they never develop the mindset of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
but they do indeed develop great compassion at all time for the sake of all sentient being
accordingly śāradvatī­putra i say that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will purify the negativity of body
similarly i say that they will purify the negativity of speech and mind
śāradvatī­putra so it be that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom refine the path to enlightenment and also enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
this complete the eighth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle maturity
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord in what circumstance do great-bodhisattva-being enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
and what be this vehicle of the bodhisattvas wherein emancipation be not attain through limited vehicle
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra whenever great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity they do not practice their generosity for the sake of a limited number of sentient being
when they practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline they do not maintain their ethical discipline for the sake of a limited number of sentient being
it be the same when they practice the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and when they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not cultivate wisdom for the sake of a limited number of sentient being
rather when they practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity they practice their generosity for the sake of all sentient being and so on in the same vein
when they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they cultivate wisdom for the sake of all sentient being
so many sentient being will i establish in enlightenment and so many sentient being will i not establish in enlightenment
great-bodhisattva-being
so many sentient being will i lead to final nirvāṇa in the expanse of non residual nirvāṇa and so many sentient being will i not lead to final nirvāṇa
for the sake of a limited number of sentient being think
do not don the great armor
rather they don the great armor for the sake of all sentient being
think i myself should complete the transcendent-perfection of generosity
i should also connect all sentient being with the transcendent-perfection of generosity
in the same vein i myself should complete the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
and the same go for the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
i myself should complete the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and i should also connect all sentient being with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
śāradvatī­putra it be to that extent that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great arm
moreover śāradvatī­putra with regard to great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
all the act of generosity that they make be offer with an omniscient mind
and make common cause with all sentient being they dedicate these act for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment without apprehend anything
this śāradvatī­putra be call the armor of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline offer by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice their generosity
they do so attentive to the omniscient mind
śāradvatī­putra whenever great-bodhisattva-being with an omniscient mind neither conceptualize these six transcendent-perfection nor apprehend they these great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice generosity
focus on the notion that sense be illusory and grant their gift without apprehend the giver the gift and the recipient
his be the armor of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom offer by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be the armor of the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
likewise the one pointedness of their mind in omniscience when they practice their generosity attentive to all sentient being without permit the mindset of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha to arise
similarly the indefatigability relentlessness and tenacity with which they persevere while practice their generosity and so forth be call the armor of the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
and for the sake of all sentient being in common they exhibit endurance satisfaction and confidence with respect to all phenomenon these attribute be call the armor of the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
they grant their generosity with a mind endow with omniscience and dedicate this for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being
this be the transcendent-perfection of generosity of great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
they do not hanker for the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha and much less still for the level of ordinary people
this be the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline possess by great-bodhisattva-being
be there no imputation of the emptiness of internal phenomenon and
be there no imputation of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
in this sacred doctrine be there no imputation of the application of mindfulness and be there no imputation of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
be there no imputation of the ten power of the tathāgata and
be there no imputation of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
in this sacred doctrine be there no imputation of enter the stream
and be there no imputation of the fruit of enter the stream
indeed be there no imputation of be tie to one more rebirth of the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth of be no long subject to rebirth of the fruit of be no long subject to rebirth of arhatship of the fruit of arhatship of the status of a pratyekabuddha of the individual enlightenment of a pratyekabuddha of a bodhisattva of the bodhisattva level of genuinely perfect enlightenment and of the genuinely perfect buddha
be there no imputation of syllable
then senior su­bhūti address these divine prince as follow
o divine prince it be so
it be just as you have speak in your thought
divine prince the enlightenment of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be inexpressible and it can not be explain
it be neither know nor cognize by anyone
divine prince so it be that those who seek to abide in the fruit of enter the stream
or who seek to actualize the fruit of enter the stream can not abide in it or actualize it without rely on this tolerance or receptivity
similarly those who seek to abide in arhatship
or who seek to actualize arhatship and
likewise those who seek to abide in individual enlightenment
or who seek to actualize individual enlightenment
and likewise those who seek to abide in genuinely perfect enlightenment
or who seek to actualize genuinely perfect enlightenment can not abide in it or actualize these fruit without rely on this tolerance or receptivity
this complete the fifteenth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
in this way divine prince great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment should abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom because it can not be hear and it can not be express
then the divine prince think
how should we uphold the doctrine reveal by the elder su­bhūti
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
with respect to all phenomenon
exhibit endurance satisfaction and confidence
this be the transcendent-perfection of tolerance possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
exhibit indefatigability relentlessness and tenacity
this be the transcendent-perfection of perseverance possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
be not separate from thought precede by great compassion owe to their attentiveness endow with omniscience and do not permit the mindset of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha to arise
senior su­bhūti know the thought of those divine prince in his own mind then address those divine prince as follow
divine prince you should uphold the view that those who teach my sacred doctrine resemble a magical display and
then the blessed one positively encourage senior su­bhūti say it be so it be so su­bhūti you be teach the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to great-bodhisattva-being and you be elate great-bodhisattva-being
senior su­bhūti then reply to the blessed one
venerable lord i be grateful and thankful that the tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha of the past along with their disciple delight induce arouse and incite the tathā­gata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha establish he in the six transcendent-perfection when he be formerly a bodhisattva
that those who listen to my sacred doctrine also resemble a magical display
they will neither hear the sacred doctrine which i have teach nor will they actualize it
then the divine prince address senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable su­bhūti be it then the case that those sentient being resemble a magical display
and that those who teach the sacred doctrine to they also resemble a magical display
similarly do those sentient being resemble a phantom
and do those who teach the sacred doctrine to they also resemble a phantom
senior su­bhūti reply
divine prince it be so it be as you have say
sentient being do resemble a magical display
and those who teach the sacred doctrine to they also resemble a magical display
sentient being do resemble a phantom
and those who teach the sacred doctrine to they also resemble a phantom
divine prince the self too be like a dream like a magical display
divine prince physical form too be like a dream like a magical display
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be like a dream like a magical display
similarly the eye too be like a dream like a magical display
similarly the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty too be like a dream like a magical display
divine prince similarly sight be like a dream like a magical display
similarly sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon be like a dream like a magical display
divine prince the sensory element of the eye too be like a dream like a magical display
similarly the sensory element of sight the sensory element of visual consciousness the sensory element of the ear the sensory element of sound the sensory element of auditory consciousness the sensory element of the nose the sensory element of odor the sensory element of olfactory consciousness the sensory element of the tongue the sensory element of taste the sensory element of gustatory consciousness the sensory element of the body the sensory element of tangible the sensory element of tactile consciousness and the sensory element of the mental faculty the sensory element of mental phenomenon and the sensory element of mental consciousness all indeed be like a dream like a magical display
similarly feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound and the other type of feeling up to and include feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound be indeed like a dream like a magical display
divine prince the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of condition phenomenon the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all intrinsic define characteristic the emptiness of all thing the emptiness of non apprehension the emptiness of non entity the emptiness of essential nature and the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be all indeed like a dream like a magical display
divine prince the application of mindfulness too be like a dream like a magical display
similarly the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path be all indeed like a dream like a magical display
divine prince the ten power of the tathāgata be also like a dream like a magical display
similarly the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be all indeed like a dream like a magical display
divine prince the transcendent-perfection of generosity too be like a dream like a magical display
divine prince similarly the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be all indeed like a dream like a magical display
similarly the fruit of enter the stream too be like a dream like a magical display
the fruit of be tie to one further rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth and the other fruit up to and include arhatship be all indeed like a dream like a magical display
similarly divine prince individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment too be like a dream like a magical display
then the divine prince address senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable su­bhūti do you just say that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be also like a dream like a magical display
venerable su­bhūti in that case do you also say that nirvāṇa be like a dream like a magical display
less still the mindset of ordinary people
this be the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
moreover śāradvatī­putra whenever great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline focus on the notion that all phenomenon be illusory
and when owe to the emptiness of inherent existence they neither make assumption about nor apprehend ethical discipline
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
śāradvatī­putra so it be that when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline they be say to don the great armor that be retain by mean of all six transcendent-perfection
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
they practice their generosity with a mind endow with omniscience
and dedicate this for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being and so on in the same vein as before
also the same go for the transcendent-perfection of perseverance just as have be indicate in the context of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
senior su­bhūti reply
divine prince i do say that nirvāṇa also be like a dream like a magical display
divine prince if there be anything else more sublime than nirvāṇa that too i say would be like a dream like a magical display
if you ask why
divine prince it be because dream magical display and nirvāṇa be without duality and can not be bisect
then senior śāradvatī­putra senior mahā­maudgalyāyana senior mahākauṣṭhila senior mahākātyāyana senior pūrṇa­maitrāyaṇī­putra and senior mahākāśyapa along with many hundred of thousand of bodhisattvas address senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable su­bhūti who can receive this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be so profound so hard to discern so hard to realize so subtle so delicate so calm and so abundant
then senior su­bhūti reply to ānanda the great śrāvakas and those great-bodhisattva-being
senior one this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be so profound which can not be investigate which be not within the perceptual range of sophistry
which be subtle hard to discern hard to realize so calm so abundant immaculate and sublime and which be to be know by the learned and the wise alone will be receive by irreversible bodhisattva
those who discern the truth arhat who have realize the depth of the sacred doctrine and fulfil their intention
great-bodhisattva-being who have carry out their duty toward the conqueror of the past and cultivate the root of virtuous action under many ten of million of buddha
or son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who have be accept by a spiritual mentor all of these may receive this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be so profound
in the same vein immaculate sublime and to be know by the learned and the wise alone whenever it be show to they
they will not construe the notion that physical form be empty and that emptiness be physical form
similarly they will not construe the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty and that emptiness be consciousness and the other aggregate
they will not construe the notion that physical form be signless and that signlessness be physical form
similarly they will not construe the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be signless and that signlessness be consciousness and the rest
they will not construe the notion that physical form be aspirationless and that aspirationlessness be physical form
similarly they will not construe the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be aspirationless and that aspirationlessness be consciousness and the rest
in the same vein as before
they will not construe the notion that physical form be non arising
and they will not construe the notion that they be unceasing that they be void and so forth
similarly they will not construe the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non arising
they will not construe the notion that physical form be calm
they will not construe the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be calm
in the same vein
in the same vein this refrain should be apply to other phenomenon up to and include the eye and feeling condition by sensory contact that be visually compound
it should similarly be apply to other phenomenon up to and include the mental faculty and feeling condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound
it should similarly be apply to the transcendent-perfection of generosity and also to the other perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it should be apply to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and also to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
it should be apply to the application of mindfulness and also to the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
it should similarly be apply to the ten power of the tathāgata and also to the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly it should be apply also to all the gateway of meditative stability and to all the gateway of mnemonic incantation
similarly it should be apply to the fruit of enter the stream and also to the other attainment up to and include individual enlightenment
so it be that these aforementione being will not construe the notion that omniscience be emptiness and that emptiness be omniscience
they will not construe the notion that omniscience be signless and that signlessness be omniscience
they will not construe the notion that omniscience be aspirationless and that aspirationlessness be omniscience
they will not construe the notion that condition element be emptiness and that emptiness be the condition element
similarly they will not construe the notion that condition element be signless and that signlessness be the condition element
they will not construe the notion that condition element be aspirationless and that aspirationlessness be the condition element
similarly as far as omniscience be concern and as far as the condition element and the unconditioned element be concern they will not construe the notion that these be non arising unceasing calm or void
then address the divine prince senior su­bhūti speak as follow
divine prince there be no one at all who will receive this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be so profound and so forth up to so immaculate and sublime and which be to be know by the learned and the wise alone
if you ask why
it be because nothing at all be express or reveal therein
insofar as there be nothing at all that be express or reveal therein there be no sentient being at all who will receive it
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have the three vehicle not be teach
that be to say have the vehicle of the śrāvaka the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddha not be extensively teach
have the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being not be teach
and have the path of the bodhisattvas also not be teach commence from the initial setting of the mind on enlightenment and continue as far as the cultivation of the mind of the ten bodhisattva level
that be to say have the transcendent-perfection of generosity and the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom not be teach
similarly have the application of mindfulness and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path not be teach
similarly have the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha not be teach
have the emanational display of great-bodhisattva-being owe to their extrasensory power of miraculous ability also not be teach
similarly have it not be teach that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will take birth miraculously
and that similarly they will be endow with the attribute of undiminished extrasensory power
and that owe to their root of virtuous action they will go to the buddhafield at will
and that they will master those very root of virtuous action which venerate respect and make offering to the lord buddhas
and that they will never squander any teaching of the sacred doctrine which they hear from those lord buddhas until they have attain perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
they become absorb in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption but they will not be reborn and they will not be captivate on account of these absorption
this be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess by great-bodhisattva-being skillful in practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
they become absorb in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption and then
through their vision of freedom and their vision of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness they may indeed enter into the level of the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
whereupon all śrāvaka and pratyekabuddhas will be overwhelmed
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess by great-bodhisattva-being skillful in practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
śāradvatī­putra it be in this way that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being don the great armor in these way then
throughout the world system from the eastern direction up to the intermediate direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
this great-bodhisattva-being in such and such a world system have don the great armor
be bring sentient being to maturity be refine the buddhafield and be even conjure emanational form through miraculous ability
all the lord buddhas who reside therein
will purposefully declare and incant in their eulogy
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord by mean of what be it say that great-bodhisattva-being who have enter upon the great vehicle ride upon the great vehicle
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the six transcendent-perfection
they achieve and then maintain the first meditative concentration where there be freedom from the passion of the sense and freedom from negative and non virtuous attribute while ideation and scrutiny be present alongside the joy and bliss that arise from freedom
they then achieve and maintain the second meditative concentration where there be an intense inner clarity free from both ideation and scrutiny the absence of ideation and scrutiny be due to one point mental focus while the joy and bliss that arise from meditative stability be present
they then achieve and maintain the third meditative concentration where bliss remain but joy be absent due to the absence of attachment to joy this be what sublime being describe as equanimous mindful and pure
and they then achieve and maintain the fourth meditative concentration where even that sense of bliss be abandon and neither suffering nor bliss be present because blissful and unhappy state of mind have both previously subside while equanimity and mindfulness be utterly pure
similarly they achieve and maintain the mind that be endow with love kindness its volition permeate a single direction of space because it be vast extensive non dual immeasurable free from enmity free from harm without rivalry perfect and well cultivate
likewise they then achieve and maintain the mind endow with love kindness the volition of which permeate a second direction of space and similarly a third a fourth the nadir the zenith the horizon and the entire universe
in the same way they then achieve and maintain the mind that be endow with compassion empathetic joy and equanimity its volition permeate the entire universe
these combined practice of the four immeasurable aspiration and the four meditative concentration form the supremely excellent great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
accordingly they also think
in order that these sentient being who over a long period of time have fall under the sway of evil associate
who continue to apprehend egotistical view
and likewise who apprehend notion of sentient being
i will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
and teach the sacred doctrine to those sentient being who continue to apprehend in such way
t that time even though great-bodhisattva-being become equipoise in the meditative stability of emptiness as a gateway to liberation as far as the realization of the finality of existence be concern
at that time even though great-bodhisattva-being become equipoise in the meditative stability of emptiness as a gateway to liberation as far as the realization of the finality of existence be concern
they do not actualize that finality of existence
through which the fruit of enter the stream
the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship and individual enlightenment be actualize
when great-bodhisattva-being be absorb in these meditative concentration conjoin with the aspect of the immeasurable aspiration replete with the appropriate sign and indication of successful practice and then arise from these meditative state
make common cause with all sentient being they act so as to perfect omniscience
this indeed śāradvatī­putra be the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
when great-bodhisattva-being their mind endow with omniscience and precede by great compassion correctly describe and communicate these meditative concentration immeasurable aspiration and formless absorption to other so that they might abandon afflict mental state
expound analyzing and elucidate they and demonstrate the drawback of their experience as well as genuine emancipation
this be the transcendent-perfection of generosity possess by great-bodhisattva-being
when those who have cultivate a mind endow with omniscience hone and cultivate the first meditative concentration and the other up to and include the fourth meditative concentration and abide in these meditative concentration without permit the cultivation of other mindset that be to say those of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
this śāradvatī­putra be the unblemished transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline possess by great-bodhisattva-being
also when any great-bodhisattva-being without be separate from the attention associate with omniscience
think i should teach the sacred doctrine to all sentient being in order that they might abandon all afflict mental state
and then exhibit endurance satisfaction investigation and contemplation with respect to those attention
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of tolerance possess by great-bodhisattva-being
also when any great-bodhisattva-being through their attention endow with omniscience constantly dedicate all the root of their virtuous action for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being and then exhibit indefatigability and relentlessness
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of perseverance possess by great-bodhisattva-being
also when any great-bodhisattva-being through their attention endow with omniscience
this be the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration possess by great-bodhisattva-being
become absorb in the meditative concentration meditative stability formless absorption and the gateway to liberation and then arise from those meditative state without descend to the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
be absorb in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption they definitively discern that all the aspect of their meditative concentration be facet of impermanence mode of suffering and aspect of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness yet they enter neither into the maturity of the śrāvakas nor into the maturity of the pratyekabuddha because these insight be retain by great compassion
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess by great-bodhisattva-being
these indeed śāradvatī­putra represent the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra the same also apply when great-bodhisattva-being definitively cultivate in all respect the four application of mindfulness
and so on up to and include notion of experiencer and experience subject might abandon these view
when great-bodhisattva-being become equipoise in the meditative stability of signlessness as a gateway to liberation
or in the meditative stability of aspirationlessness
at that time they do actualize all thing that be free from contaminant
and yet as far as the actualization of the finality of existence be concern
they do not actualize that finality of existence through which the fruit of enter the stream and so forth up to and include individual enlightenment be actualize
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly and who have set their mind on enlightenment and these root of virtuous action do not in the interim actualize the finality of existence
they will not degenerate from the four meditative concentration the four formless concentration the four application of mindfulness and so on
they will not degenerate from the noble eightfold path
they will not degenerate from emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness the gateway to liberation
similarly they will not degenerate from the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
have it not be teach that they will always be equipoise in meditation without have to assume the guise of equipoise
and that they will be endow with unimpeded inspiration uninterrupted inspiration rational inspiration well connect inspiration purposeful inspiration and distinguished supramundane inspiration
in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the three vehicle have be teach
senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra it be so it be just as you have say
that be to say the vehicle of the śrāvaka the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddha have be extensively teach
the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being have be teach
and in the same vein
all those other attribute you mention have be teach up to and include how great-bodhisattva-being will be endow with distinguished supramundane inspiration
but these have all be teach without apprehend anything
the nature of knower and other postulate subject up to and include viewer have be teach without apprehend anything
similarly physical form have be teach without apprehend anything
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness have be teach without apprehend anything
similarly the transcendent-perfection of generosity have be teach without apprehend anything
and the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have be teach without apprehend anything
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly
until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment they will not degenerate from all the causal attribute that be aspect of enlightenment or from all the fruitional attribute of the buddha
always retain by skill in mean and enhance by virtuous attribute
their sense faculty become keener unlike the sense faculty of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being perceive sentient being
they think for a long period of time these sentient being have be engage in four misconception
the notion that there be permanence
the notion that there be happiness
the notion that there be a self
and the notion that existence be pleasant
i should attain enlightenment for the sake of those sentient being
by any mean i should swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and teach they the sacred doctrine that all thing be impermanent imbue with suffering and without a self and that nirvāṇa be peace
although they have set their mind accordingly on enlightenment and practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom through skill in mean they will not enter into the meditative stability of the buddha
at that time they possess the ten power of the tathāgata
the four assurance
the four unhindered discernment
great loving kindness
great compassion
and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and though they may even become equipoise in those fruitional attribute
they will not actualize the finality of existence until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the emptiness of internal phenomenon have be teach without apprehend anything
and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity have be teach without apprehend anything
other phenomenon up to and include the application of mindfulness have be teach without apprehend anything
and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path have be teach without apprehend anything
similarly the ten power of the tathāgata have be teach without apprehend anything
and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha have be teach without apprehend anything
indeed the attainment up to and include omniscience have be teach without apprehend anything
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti why in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the three vehicle teach without apprehend anything
similarly why be the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being teach
senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
and why be all those other attribute i mention up to and include the fact that great-bodhisattva-being will be endow with distinguished supramundane inspiration teach without apprehend anything
senior śāradvatī­putra it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon that the three vehicle have be extensively teach without apprehend anything
similarly it be owe to the emptiness of external phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that the three vehicle have be extensively teach without apprehend anything
similarly it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon that the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being have be teach
and in the same vein
venerable lord when all thing be indivisible signless
and empty of their own define characteristic how could the cultivation of the six transcendent-perfection be fulfil
how could they be differently designate
how could they be differentiate
and likewise all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
and when they cultivate in all respect the meditative stability of emptiness the meditative stability of signlessness and the meditative stability of aspirationlessness
and when they cultivate in all respect all the other fruitional attribute from the ten power of the tathāgata up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
this śāradvatī­putra be the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being be absorb in love kindness
they focus on the nature of mind that benefit sentient being think i should save all sentient being
also when they be absorb in compassion they focus on the nature of mind that direct compassion and love to all those being
and when they be absorb in empathetic joy they also focus on all sentient being think i should liberate all sentient being
also when they be absorb in equanimity they focus on those being meditate may all sentient being achieve the cessation of contaminant
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of generosity possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the four immeasurable aspiration
also when any great-bodhisattva-being become absorb in the aspect of those meditative concentration immeasurable aspiration and formless absorption replete with the appropriat‌e sign and indication of success in practice and then
arise from those meditative state without dedicate their merit to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha and instead only dedicate it to omniscience
this be the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
when great-bodhisattva-being through their attention endow with omniscience abide in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption without confuse they
and do not desire those two level the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha but accept and desire only omniscience
this be the transcendent-perfection of tolerance possess by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being perceive sentient being they think alas for a long period of time these sentient being have fall under the sway of evil associate
and they have continue to engage in an apprehending manner in the follow view
the concept of self
or the concept of sentient being
or in the same vein concept of other postulate subject up to and include the concept of a knower
or similarly the concept of physical form
the concept of feeling
the concept of perception
the concept of formative predisposition
the concept of consciousness
the concept of sensory element
and the concept of sense field
for the sake of those sentient being when i have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment then i should ensure by any mean through the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless meditative absorption and the four attractive quality of a bodhisattva that those sentient being act appropriately so that the fault of the perceptual view associate with those sentient being do not arise
when those with skill in mean have set their mind accordingly on enlightenment and practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom even if they perfectly acquire the ten power of the tathāgata and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha on account of their view with regard to sentient being they will not actualize the finality of existence but after cultivate the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness they will become perfect
venerable lord when all thing be gather in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom how could the transcendent-perfection of generosity exist
similarly how could the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration exist
in the same vein how could all other causal and fruitional attribute
up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha exist
venerable lord when all thing be without define characteristic how could a single define characteristic be designate
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom dispense their generosity toward all sentient being
maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike
which be like an echo
like an optical aberration
like a mirage
like a magical display
and similarly maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like an echo like an optical aberration like a mirage like a magical display and like a phantom
dispense their generosity toward all sentient being
similarly they maintain their ethical discipline
cultivate tolerance
undertake perseverance
become equipoise in the meditative concentration
and cultivate wisdom
the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike be without define characteristic
similarly the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like an echo like an optical aberration like a mirage like a magical display and like a phantom be without define characteristic
if you ask why su­bhūti
it be because a dream be without any essential nature and an echo an optical aberration a mirage a magical display and a phantom be without any essential nature
anything that be without essential nature be also without define characteristic
that which be without define characteristic have the sole define characteristic that it be without define characteristic
therefore su­bhūti
for this reason you should know that the transcendent-perfection of generosity be without define characteristic
the dispenser of generosity be without define characteristic
and the recipient be without define characteristic
those who know this dispense generosity and so forth
do not transgress the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration or the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
abide in these six transcendent-perfection
they perfect the four meditative concentration
similarly they perfect the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the three gateway to liberation
and similarly they perfect the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption
similarly they perfect the emptiness of internal phenomenon
similarly they perfect the other aspect of emptiness from the emptiness of external phenomenon and the emptiness of non entity up to the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
similarly they perfect the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative equipoise the five extrasensory power the five hundred gateway of mnemonic incantation the five hundred gateway of meditative stability the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
this be the transcendent-perfection of perseverance possess by great-bodhisattva-being who abide in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
also when any great-bodhisattva-being through their attention endow with omniscience maintain their indefatigability and relentlessness in order to abandon non virtuous action and adopt virtuous action
also when any great-bodhisattva-being become absorb in those meditative concentration immeasurable aspiration and formless absorption and then arise from those meditative state but be not captivate by those meditative concentration immeasurable aspiration and formless absorption and be not subject to rebirth on account of they
this be the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration originate from the skillful mean of great-bodhisattva-being who abide in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
also when any great-bodhisattva-being through their attention endow with omniscience
be absorb in the meditative stability of the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption and
then arise from those state but definitively discern that all of those be facet of impermanence mode of suffering aspect of selflessness and aspect of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness without enter either into the maturity of the śrāvaka or into the maturity of the pratyekabuddha
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom originate from the skillful mean of great-bodhisattva-being who practice the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
śāradvatī­putra these six transcendent-perfection of great-bodhisattva-being be the great vehicle that be retain by skillful mean originate from the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
moreover śāradvatī­putra the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being understand the emptiness of internal phenomenon without apprehend anything
likewise in the same vein it also understand all the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity without apprehend anything
moreover śāradvatī­putra the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being do not cause one to know that all thing be distraction or this be meditative equipoise
moreover śāradvatī­putra the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being do not cause one to know that this be permanent or this be impermanent
similarly in the same vein it do not cause one to know that this be imbue with happiness this be imbue with suffer this be a self or this be not a self and it do so without apprehend anything
moreover śāradvatī­putra the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
do not cause one to know past time
it do not cause one to know future time and present time
nor do it not cause one to know the three time but it do so without apprehend anything
do not cause one to know the world system of desire
it do not cause one to know the world system of form and the world system of formlessness
nor do it not cause one to know the three world system but it do so without apprehend anything
do not cause one to know mundane phenomenon
it do not cause one to know supramundane condition unconditioned contaminate and uncontaminated phenomenon
nor do it not cause one to know mundane phenomenon
and nor do it not cause one to know supramundane condition unconditioned contaminate and uncontaminated phenomenon
but it do so without apprehend anything
śāradvatī­putra that on which great-bodhisattva-being abide be the great vehicle that enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
this be not the emancipation associate with limited vehicle that be to say with the vehicle of the śrāvaka or the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha
if you ask why
it be because the great vehicle and the great armor be not distinct from one another the great armor itself be the great vehicle and the great vehicle itself be the great armor
it be the great vehicle and the great armor that constitute the maturity of the bodhisattvas
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord to what extent be it say of great-bodhisattva-being that they abide in the great vehicle
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
that all the aforementione attribute up to and include the fact that great-bodhisattva-being will be endow with distinguished supramundane inspiration have be teach without apprehend anything
that the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being have be teach
similarly it be owe to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
ah this sacred doctrine which the elder su­bhūti have explain describe and teach through the power of the tathāgata through the blessing of the tathāgata through the potent force of the tathāgata have indeed be eloquently explain
then the god and goddess in the entourage of indra
those in the entourage of brahmā those in the entourage of prajā­pati and those of the trayas­triṃśa realm who be all present in that assembly three time utter the following meaningful expression
ah this sacred doctrine have be eloquently explain
ah this sacred doctrine have be eloquently explain
we should accept as the tathāgata those great-bodhisattva-being who be not separate from this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
for although physical form or feeling or perception or formative predisposition or consciousness or
in the same vein
anything else up to and include omniscience be non apprehensible the three vehicle be nonetheless establish
that be to say the three vehicle be indeed designate as the vehicle of the śrāvaka the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddha
then the blessed one say to those god in the entourage of indra
divine prince it be so it be just as you have speak
although physical form or feeling or perception or formative predisposition or consciousness or
divine prince you should accept as if they be tathāgata those bodhisattva who be without apprehend anything not separate from this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
divine prince it be because in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the three vehicle
namely the vehicle of the śrāvaka the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddha be extensively teach
and yet divine prince apart from engage in the transcendent-perfection of generosity the tathāgata do not apprehend anything and apart from engage in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the tathāgata do not apprehend anything
similarly apart from engage in the emptiness of internal phenomenon and apart from engage in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity the tathāgata do not apprehend anything
nor do the tathāgata apprehend anything apart from engage in the application of mindfulness and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
similarly the tathāgata do not apprehend anything apart from engage in the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
nor indeed do the tathāgata apprehend anything apart from engage in omniscience
divine prince bodhisattva should indeed train in all these
that be to say they should train in the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein in all other aforementioned attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
divine prince it be for that reason that you should know great-bodhisattva-being who practice this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom inseparably to be like the tathāgata
likewise i be not separate from the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
i be without apprehend anything not separate from the transcendent-perfection of generosity
divine prince when i scatter five lotus flower as an offering to the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha dīpaṃkara in the padma­vatī royal court and while stand in the middle of the market
that be to say the three vehicle be indeed designate as the vehicle of the śrāvaka the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha and the vehicle of the genuinely perfe
likewise i be not separate from the emptiness of internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
likewise i be not separate from the application of mindfulness and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
likewise i be not separate from the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption all the meditative stability of the bodhisattvas all the gateway of mnemonic incantation the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then the divine prince say to the blessed one
you will become the lord buddha śākyamuni a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha endow with knowledge and virtuous conduct a sugata who know the world a conductor of living creature who be to be train and an unsurpassed teacher of god and human
at that time the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha dīpaṃkara foreordain
that i would attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment say o my child of enlighten heritage in the future after countless eon in this world system during the auspicious eon
venerable lord it be wonderful how much this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom benefit great-bodhisattva-being without relinquish omniscience
then the blessed one comprehend that all four assembly be gather and present that be to say
the fully ordain monk the fully ordain nun layman and laywoman along with great-bodhisattva-being the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm
and in the same vein the assembled god of all the other realm up to and include akaniṣṭha
establish they all as witness he address śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika when those great-bodhisattva-being or fully ordain monk fully ordain nun laymen laywoman god divine prince or divine princess have hear this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and be never separate from the mind endow with omniscience there be malign demonic force and their acolyte who would seek an opportunity to harm they but will find no such opportunity or occasion to do so
if you ask why
it be because these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will have be totally consecrate in the understanding that physical form be emptiness
and similarly they will have be totally consecrate in the understanding that feeling be emptiness perception be emptiness formative predisposition be emptiness and consciousness be emptiness
which arise from the maturation of past action
and be sublime and free from contaminant
abide in these attribute
they traverse the world system of the eastern direction and so forth numerous as the sand of the river gange
and then venerate the lord buddhas
and serve they with all resource
and serve they with all resource
they always work for the sake of all sentient being
they attract by their generosity those sentient being who be attract by generosity
they attract by wisdom and so forth those sentient being who be attract by ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom
they attract by all the root of virtuous action those sentient being who be attract by all the root of virtuous action
endow with mastery over all thing they participate in cyclic existence
but be untainted by the defect of cyclic existence
for the sake of sentient being they hold and accept the excellent resource of god and human
endow with these they attract sentient being with the material thing that attract they
understand that all thing be without define characteristic
they then think that they should subsequently attain omniscience
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being know that all thing be without define characteristic
and then go on to attain omniscience
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike
perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like an echo like an optical aberration like a magical display like a mirage and like a phantom
know the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike these great-bodhisattva-being
perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline which be without define characteristic
similarly know the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like an echo like an optical aberration like a mirage like a magical display and like a phantom
they perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline which be without define characteristic non degenerate faultless uncontaminated unsullied free from dogmatic assumption abundant in splendor praise by the learn utterly perfect excellently adopt include in the sublime path free from contaminant and supramundane
they abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and because they act without apprehend anything
they do not apprehend gift they do not apprehend their transcendent-perfection of generosity nor do they apprehend recipient
similarly when they practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth and because they act without apprehend anything
they do not apprehend virtuous phenomenon nor do they apprehend non virtuous determinate indeterminate mundane supramundane condition unconditioned contaminate or uncontaminated phenomenon
they do not apprehend the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom or the cultivator of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
śāradvatī­putra it be to that extent that great-bodhisattva-being be say to abide in the great vehicle
moreover śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being their unconfused mind endow with omniscience should cultivate the four application of mindfulness in order to terminate this cultivation and they do so without apprehend anything
all in order to put an end to cultivation and they do so without apprehend anything
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who undertake cultivation accordingly be say to abide in the great vehicle
maintain these attribute they adopt the precept and maintain the conventional ethical discipline
similarly they acquire the precept on the basis of actual reality maintain the ethical discipline associate with mental restraint and the ethical discipline of habitual conduct
through this ethical discipline may i be reborn equal in fortune to the royal class stand out like a tall sāl tree
similarly they do not think may i be reborn equal in fortune to the priestly class stand out like a tall sāl tree or among the householder class stand out like a great sāl tree
similarly they do not think may i be reborn as a universal monarch lord of the four continent
similarly they do not think through this ethical discipline may i be reborn equal in fortune to the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm
similarly they do not think may i be reborn equal in fortune to the god of the trayas­triṃśa realm to those of the tuṣita realm those of the nirmāṇa­rata realm and those of the para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm
similarly they do not think through this ethical discipline may i attain the fruit of one who have enter the stream or the fruit of one tie to one more rebirth or the fruit of one who be no long subject to rebirth or arhatship or the fruit of individual enlightenment or the maturity of the bodhisattvas or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
endow with such discipline
they do not assert the supremacy of anything at all and so they do not think
if you ask why
it be because it be absolutely firmly establish that all thing be without define characteristic
thing that be without define characteristic can not acquire thing that be without define characteristic
nor can thing that have dissimilar define characteristic acquire thing that have dissimilar define characteristic
nor can thing without define characteristic acquire thing with dissimilar define characteristic
nor can thing with dissimilar define characteristic acquire thing without define characteristic
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline that be without define characteristic
and having embark on the maturity of the bodhisattvas will accept that phenomenon be non arising
thereupon they will attain the five extrasensory power which arise through the maturation of past action
and they will also attain the five hundred gateway of mnemonic incantation the five hundred gateway of meditative stability and the four unhindered discernment
then they will venerate the lord buddhas bring sentient being to maturation and also refine the buddhafield
they will move from buddhafield to buddhafield
then even if they frequent cyclic existence with its five class of live being they will not be sully at all by the fault of cyclic existence
just as a phantom may stand sit move walk and even lie down but remain unsullie by the positive and negative effect of past action
in the same way they may also act on behalf of sentient being without apprehend sentient being or even the designation of sentient being
just as a tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who be say to be utterly calm and who after turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine no long apprehend anyone foreordain to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
may then let go of the formative predisposition of his current lifespan having send forth an emanation
and pass into final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
in the same way great-bodhisattva-being may even act on behalf of sentient being without apprehend sentient being or even the designation of sentient being
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike and maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like a phantom and so on
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance in two way
it be because there be no opportunity for emptiness to impinge upon emptiness
there be no opportunity for signlessness to impinge upon signlessness
there be no opportunity for aspirationlessness to impinge upon aspirationlessness
in the same vein as before
these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will have be totally consecrate in the understanding that all thing up to and include omniscience be emptiness
it be because both the thing whereby they would find an opportunity to impinge upon they and the thing upon which they would find an opportunity to impinge be without inherent existence
kauśika the human or non human who seek an opportunity to impinge upon those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will find no such opportunity
kauśika it be because these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage totally cultivate thought of love kindness toward all sentient being
and similarly they totally cultivate thought of compassion thought of empathetic joy and thought of equanimity and they do so without apprehend anything
kauśika those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will not die in unfavorable circumstance
if you ask why
the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity will be respect because they furnish all sentient being with genuine happiness
they should never be separate from the mind endow with omniscience
similarly they should cultivate the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation the ten power of the tathāgata and so on up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
moreover śāradvatī­putra owe to the non apprehension of sentient being great-bodhisattva-being understand that a so call bodhisattva be a mere name or conventional term
those god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm situate throughout the world system of the great trichiliocosm
along with those god of the trayas­triṃśa realm those of the yāma realm those of the tuṣita realm
those of the nirmāṇa­rata realm those of the para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm those of the mahā]brahmā realm
those of the ābhāsvara realm those of the śubha­kṛtsna realm
and those of the bṛhat­phala realm who have embark upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
but have not yet hear accept maintain and comprehend this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should always listen to accept maintain and comprehend this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom attend to it in the correct manner and
moreover kauśika if these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage accept maintain recite comprehend and attend in the correct manner to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and if they be never separate from the mind endow with omniscience
they will never be terrify afraid or experience their body hair stiff due to fear whether they be stay in an empty hut whether they be stay in an expose place or whether they be stay in an open hall or pavilion
kauśika it be because these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage totally cultivate the emptiness of internal phenomenon but always without apprehend anything
similarly they totally cultivate the emptiness of external phenomenon but always without apprehend anything
similarly they totally cultivate the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity but always without apprehend anything
then the god situate throughout this world system of the great trichiliocosm that be to say
the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm along with the god of the trayas­triṃśa realm
those of the yāma realm those of the tuṣita realm those of the nirmāṇa­rata realm
those of the para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm and those of the other realm up to and include the pure abodes say to the blessed one
if you ask what these two be they comprise the tolerance of suffering and the tolerance that understand the profound nature of phenomenon
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perceive sentient being under the sway of evil associate they think
alas for a long period of time these sentient being have engage with sign that be to say they have engage with sign denote the female gender the male gender sign of visible form and sign of sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
when i have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
then by any mean i should ensure that those sentient being act appropriately so that the fault associate with those sentient being do not arise
when those endow with skill in mean have set their mind on enlightenment
even if they perfectly acquire the ten power of the tathāgata and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha on account of their view with regard to sentient being
they will not actualize the finality of existence but after cultivate the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness they will become perfect
it be impossible and there be no chance su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection who investigate the emptiness of internal phenomenon and who possess such attribute of pristine cognition would perceive formative predisposition as imbue with happiness describe formative predisposition as be imbue with happiness or enter into association with the three world system that be an impossibility
when great-bodhisattva-being practice accordingly it should be ask how do great-bodhisattva-being who wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment investigate these fruitional attribute and become equipoise in the meditative stability of emptiness without actualize the finality of existence through which the fruit of enter the stream
the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
arhatship
and individual enlightenment be attain
and in which non arising non cessation non conditioning and non entity be not realize
the same refrain may be extensively apply also to the meditative stability of signlessness and aspirationlessness
among they the tolerance of suffering imply that
from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they be seat at the focal point of enlightenment even if all sentient being be to arrive in the presence of those great-bodhisattva-being
and reprimand and rebuke they with harsh word or strike they with clod of earth club weapon or tool these great-bodhisattva-being seek to perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance would not have even the slight thought imbue with anger or malice
but they would discern those being think o these sentient being be torment by the ailment of afflict mental state
above all i should exercise compassion and i should not have negative thought
i have put an end to the grasping of those five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which revert to hostility when they act accordingly with love kindness and compassion this be call the tolerance of suffering
if you ask what be the tolerance that understand the profound nature of phenomenon
it be as follow since even those sentient being who presently assume such inimical form be ultimately non apprehensible
if one be to ask why
bodhisattvas should think who be scold or reprimand i with harsh word who be beat i with club strike i with weapon and whip i
venerable lord we shall always guard and shelter those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who accept affirm maintain recite and explain this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom demonstrate it extensively to other and attend to it in the correct manner and who be never separate from the mind endow with omniscience
venerable lord it be because dependent on those great-bodhisattva-being rebirth among the denizen of the hell will be cut off
and rebirth in the animal realm will be cut off
while destitute god destitute nāga destitute yakṣas destitute human and all epidemic misfortune contagious disease and hostility will not arise or else they will not occur or else they will be alleviate
similarly all famine conflict and civil war will be interrupt alleviate and become non existent
venerable lord it be similarly because dependent on those great-bodhisattva-being the way of the ten virtuous action will emerge in the world
and likewise the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption will emerge in the world
just as the transcendent-perfection of generosity will emerge in the world
so will the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom emerge in the world
similarly it be because dependent on these bodhisattva the emptiness of internal phenomenon will emerge in the world
similarly the four application of mindfulness will emerge in the world
and in the same vein
all causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha will emerge in the world
similarly all attainment up to and include omniscience will emerge in the world
moreover venerable lord it be dependent on these great-bodhisattva-being that the royal class and particularly those who stand out like mighty sāl tree will emerge in the world
and similarly that the priestly class and particularly those who stand out like mighty sāl tree will emerge in the world
all formative predisposition be illusion like
they be void hollow vacuous and like space
they be without a self sentient being living creature life individual humankind and human being
all conceptualize be unreal
since they derive from imagination who in fact be scold or strike i
since they derive from imagination who in fact be scold or strike i
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be question by other great-bodhisattva-being in that manner
if they respond that when they cultivate all the aspect of enlightenment they should be attentive to emptiness
and they should be attentive to non conditioning and non cessation
they should be attentive to signlessness and aspirationlessness
instead of demonstrate the altruistic attitude that sentient being should not be forsake
or respond with skill in mean
one should know that these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have not be foreordain by the lord buddhas to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
it be because great-bodhisattva-being do not speak of demonstrate or analyze their investigation of the irreversible level
su­bhūti these great-bodhisattva-being should know that great-bodhisattva-being who have precisely investigate the six transcendent-perfection on the irreversible level will not regress to the level of attenuate refinement of the śrāvakas
venerable lord be there a reason why great-bodhisattva-being may be style irreversible
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti there be
su­bhūti whether or not they have attain the six transcendent-perfection irreversible bodhisattva will respond precisely in the manner of an irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
that the householder class and particularly those who stand out like mighty sāl tree will emerge in the world
and similarly that universal monarchs will emerge in the world
venerable lord similarly it be dependent on these great-bodhisattva-being that the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm be discern
and similarly that the god of the other realm up to and include akaniṣṭha be discern
venerable lord similarly it be dependent on these great-bodhisattva-being that the fruit of enter the stream be discern
and likewise that those individual who enter the stream be discern
and similarly that the fruit of be tie to one further rebirth
the individual who be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth the individual who be no long subject to rebirth
and similarly the fruit of arhatship and actual arhat be all discern
and likewise too that individual enlightenment be discern
and that pratyekabuddha be discern
venerable lord similarly it be dependent on these great-bodhisattva-being that the maturation of all sentient being be discern
that the refinement of the buddhafield be discern
that the tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha be discern
that those who turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine be discern in the world
and similarly that the precious jewel of the buddha emerge
that the precious jewel of the dharma emerge
and that the precious jewel of the saṅgha emerge
venerable lord for these reason we will ensure that the bodhisattvas will be guard sheltered and conceal by the world with its god human and antigod
the blessed one then address śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika it be so it be just as you have speak
kauśika it be dependent on these great-bodhisattva-being that rebirth among the denizen of the hell will be cut off
and in the same vein
that the world of yama will be cut off
that rebirth in the animal realm will be cut off
that all those aforementione attribute up to and include the precious jewel of the buddha will emerge in the world
and that similarly the precious jewel of the sacred doctrine and the precious jewel of the monastic community will emerge in the world
you should guard shelter and conceal they so that their activity be never interrupt
kauśika so it be that these great-bodhisattva-being should be honor venerate respected and grant offering by the world with its god human and antigod
consider that i be worthy of be honor venerate respected and grant offering
kauśika those who think that great-bodhisattva-being should be honor venerate respected and grant offering
kauśika so it be that that these great-bodhisattva-being should be honor venerate respected and grant offering by the world with its god human and antigod
if you ask why
kauśika it be because great-bodhisattva-being and the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be not present in the world dependent on the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
kauśika if this world system of the great trichiliocosm be fill entirely with śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
like a grove of reed like a grove of bamboo like a grove of sugar cane like a paddy field of rice or like a field of sesame and
if some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to honor venerate respect and grant offering to they
that latter child of enlighten heritage would generate much great merit
with all their necessity as long as they live but there be one who instead would honor venerate respect and grant offering to a single great-bodhisattva-being who have just begin to set his or her mind on enlightenment and be not separate from the six transcendent-perfection
rather kauśika it be dependent on great-bodhisattva-being that the śrāvakas pratyekabuddhas
and similarly the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be present in the world
kauśika so it be that you should always ensure that great-bodhisattva-being be honor venerate respected and grant offering by the world with its god human and antigod
this complete the sixteenth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle conceptual notions
you should guard shelter and conceal they so that their activity be never interrupt
then senior śāradvatī­putra say to the blessed one
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom shed light owe to its utter purity
venerable lord i pay homage to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be unsullie by the three world system
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom dispel the blindness of afflict mental state and all false view
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have precedence over all branch of enlightenment
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom secure happiness distinct from all fear enmity and harmful thought or deed
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom bring light to all sentient being so that they might acquire the five eye
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom demonstrate the path to those who be go astray so that they might abandon the two extreme
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be omniscience so that all afflict mental state and involuntary reincarnation through propensity might be abandon
similarly it follow that so call physical form be nothing but a mere designation
and the same go for feeling perception and formative predisposition because they too be non apprehensible
also since consciousness be non apprehensible it follow that so call consciousness be nothing but a mere name or conventional term
since the eye be non apprehensible it follow that so call eye be nothing but a mere name or conventional term
similarly since the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty be non apprehensible it follow that so call ear nose tongue body and mental faculty be nothing but mere name or conventional term
similarly since sight be non apprehensible it follow that so call sight be nothing but a mere name or conventional term
similarly since sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon be non apprehensible it follow that so call sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon be nothing but mere name or conventional term
since the application of mindfulness be non apprehensible it follow that the so call four application of mindfulness be nothing but mere name or conventional term
and the same go for all other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path since they be all non apprehensible it follow that the same go for the so call four correct exertion four support for miraculous ability five faculty five power seven branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
in the same way since the emptiness of internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be non apprehensible they be nothing but mere name or conventional term
likewise the so call ten power of the tathāgata be nothing but mere name or conventional term and the same go for the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha since these be all non apprehensible it follow that all fruitional attribute up to and include the so call eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be nothing but mere name or conventional term
since unconditioned phenomena up to an include the finality of existence be non apprehensible it follow that the so call real nature expanse of reality maturity and finality of existence be all nothing but mere name or conventional term
since enlightenment be non apprehensible it follow that this so call enlightenment be nothing but a mere name or conventional term
and in the same way since a genuinely perfect buddha be non apprehensible it be nothing but a mere name or conventional term
śāradvatī­putra it be to that extent that great-bodhisattva-being be say to abide in the great vehicle
moreover śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
perfect the five extrasensory power which be without degeneration and they bring sentient being to maturity
they also refine the buddhafield they pass from one buddhafield to another buddha field
they honor venerate respect and make offering to the lord buddhas and they repeatedly listen to the sacred doctrine of this most supreme vehicle of the bodhisattvas in the presence of those lord buddhas
mount on this vehicle they proceed to the buddhafield in order to benefit sentient being and in order to behold the buddha but in addition they be without the notion of a buddhafield they be without the notion of sentient being and they be even without the notion of a buddha
indeed abide on the level of non duality they acquire as many corporeal form as will facilitate their appropriate act for the welfare of sentient being
until they attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment they will never be separate from this great vehicle
having obtain omniscience
then senior ānanda ask the blessed one
who do not develop faith in this exegesis of the profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord be there not some among the class of sentient being
who be not motivate by joy confidence and high aspiration
who do not make offering to the assembly with body and mind
who even depart from this assembly and in addition
who have abandon it and be abandon it
the blessed one reply
ānanda among the class of sentient being there be indeed some
and who even walk away from this assembly
if you ask why
it be because they walk away in the past when this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be explain
and they also walk away at the present when this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be be explain
they do not make offering to the assembly with body and mind and
they accrue deed that obscure wisdom
those who have engage in and accrue deed that obscure wisdom
abandon this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
by obstruct this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they obstruct the omniscience of the lord buddhas of the past future and present
those who have engage in and accrue deed that abandon omniscience
accrue deed that be destitute of the sacred doctrine
those who have engage in and accrue deed that be destitute of the sacred doctrine
will roast among the denizen of the hell for many hundred of year for many thousand of year for many hundred of thousand of year and for many hundred of billion trillion year
then they will proceed to the great hell where they will be incinerate by an inferno
having be incinerate they will become sentient denizen of the great hell in other world system
they will be reborn therein
and they will burn therein for many hundred of year for many thousand of year for many hundred of thousand of year and for many hundred of billion trillion year
then from those great hell they will again proceed to the great hell
even after depart thence they will once again be incinerate by an inferno
and having be incinerate they will again become sentient denizen of the great hell in other world system
from the great hell they will once again proceed to the great hell
reborn therein they will burn for many hundred of billion trillion year
move from the great hell to the great hell
they will again be incinerate by an inferno and after be incinerate
move from the great hell to the great hell
they will be cast by the wind of past action into the eastern direction and
then cast in the other direction up to and include the intermediate direction
then when they be reborn they will again proceed from great hell to great hell
again they will be incinerate by an inferno and having be incinerate they will pass away
those who have engage in and accrue deed that be destitute of the sacred doctrine
will once again be reborn and again they will proceed from great hell to great hell
again they will experience the suffering of the denizen of the hell in the great hell for many hundred of billion trillion year
for as long as they be incinerate by an inferno they will experience the suffering of the denizen of the hell
then after be incinerate they will pass away and be reborn in this world system
here they will be reborn in the world system of all the ten direction equal in fortune to those who be bear within the animal realm
just as they will be equal in fortune to those who be bear within the animal realm
so they will be reborn within the world system of the ten direction
having be bear therein
they will again experience the suffering of those who frequent the world of yama the lord of death for many hundred of billion trillion year
then when the suffering of those who frequent the world of yama the lord of death have come to an end
they will be reborn equal in fortune to human being but among blind householder or among outcaste householder or among householder who be refuse scavenger
be reborn in those state they will become blind lame decrepit or without a tongue
without arm without leg without ear with leprosy or morbid pallor or
else without all their limb intact
they will always be reborn in world where the word buddha be unheard where the word dharma be unheard and where the word saṅgha be unheard
if you ask why
it be because they will have engage in and accrue deed that be destitute of the sacred doctrine
and the consequence of having adopt such action will have be fully satisfied
then senior ānanda say to the blessed one
venerable lord the inexpiable crime be five in number
this engage in and accruing of deed that be destitute of the sacred doctrine would be the sixth
the blessed one reply
ānanda those individual be not say to be superior but utterly debase
when this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be explain and demonstrate
they think they should oppose this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
say this be not the vinaya this be not the teaching of the teacher
this have not be speak by the tathā­gata
we and you should not undertake training in it
they themselves abandon it and they also separate many sentient being from it
they injure their own mind and they also intend to injure the mind of other
having poison their own mind they also intend to poison the mind of other
they themselves have degenerate from the pathway to the high realm and to liberation from cyclic existence
and they intend to induce other also to degenerate from the pathway to the high realm and to liberation from cyclic existence
they themselves neither understand nor comprehend this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they intend to abandon it and they also induce other to do so
ānanda i do not rejoice when this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be proclaim to such individual and
i be displeased when i hear they let alone see they let alone consort with they
if you ask why
ānanda it be because such individual defame the sacred doctrine
they be like rotten tree and they side with evil
ānanda such individual who intend other to listen to they will be destitute owe to their unethical behavior
ānanda any individual who would defame the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should comprehend the final outcome
those who have commit the fault of defame the sacred doctrine
will become denizen of the hell animal or individual frequent the world of yama the lord of death
venerable lord the blessed one have not speak of the physical state of those individual who will be reborn in the inferior realm having defame the sacred doctrine
the blessed one reply
ānanda leave aside this description of the physical state of those individual who will be reborn in the inferior realm having defame the sacred doctrine
if one be to hear the description of the physical state of those individual who have defame the sacred doctrine
one would vomit blood from the mouth and die or

therefore ānanda this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be most important because through it the sentient being of the world system of the great trichiliocosm become establish in accordance with the deed of the buddha
ānanda you should know that the attainment of buddhahood occur in whichever world system the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom prevail
ānanda it resemble for example a priceless gemstone which be endow with the following attribute
no matter where this precious gemstone be place no human being seek to intrude and cause harm would have a chance

ānanda if this precious gemstone be immerse in turbid water the water would become clear
accordingly ānanda this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom like a precious gemstone be the source of all positive attribute and
it alleviate all negativity
then senior ānanda ask the blessed one
venerable lord do this precious gemstone exist among the god or do it exist among human
the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow
ānanda this precious gemstone indeed exist among the god
this precious gemstone indeed exist among the human being of jambu­dvīpa
however the precious gemstone that exist among the human being of jambu­dvīpa have few attribute
whereas the precious gemstone that exist among the god realm have immeasurable attribute
even the basket in which the precious gemstone of the god realm be keep be endow with its positive attribute
there be some who will acquire those same attribute even on touch this basket
ānanda this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom resemble the precious gemstone of the god realm
those who commit this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write
should know that the locale in which this scripture be place will experience no harm whatsoever
they should also observe that the attribute of the definitive transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom

it be for this reason that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be describe as omniscient master of all phenomenon
they be worthy of honor veneration respect and offer in the world of god human and antigod
if you ask why
it be because they be the repository of the six transcendent-perfection
in the same vein as before
the tathāgata accept the offering because they be the repository of the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and of the pristine cognition of omniscience great compassion and great loving kindness
similarly they accept the offering because they be the repository of the transcendent-perfection in whom afflict mental state and all involuntary reincarnation through propensity have be abandon and who likewise be without affliction or purification without arise or ceasing without acceptance or rejection and without stand sit go come or abide
moreover ānanda when on the one hand there be some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who for an eon a period exceed an eon a hundred eon a thousand eon a hundred thousand eon many hundred of eon many thousand of eon many hundred thousand of eon or many hundred of billion trillion eon honor venerate respect and make offering with flower garland perfume unguent powder religious robe clothing parasol victory banner ribbon and diverse musical sound to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha of the world system of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges and similarly to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha of the world system of the southern western and northern direction along with the nadir the zenith and likewise the four intermediate direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges and
on the other hand there be some other son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who retain hold recite and master this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and be attentive to it in the correct manner commit it to write and have it committed to writing and who then honor venerate respect and make offering to this volume of the scripture with flower garland perfume unguent powder religious robe clothing parasol victory banner ribbon and diverse musical sound
among these stock of merit the stock of merit acquire through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be supreme foremost superior and unsurpassed in contrast to the aforementioned stock of merit acquire through make offering to the tathāgata
if you ask why
ānanda the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
whose stock of merit be acquire through make offering to the tathāgata but lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be reborn among the god and among human being
they roam within cyclic existence and they do not perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if they do not perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will not perfect the ten power of the tathāgata
and in the same vein they will not perfect the other fruitional attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
ānanda those who retain hold and so forth this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
be attentive to it in the correct manner will perfect the definitive transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they will perfect the other transcendent-perfection from the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration up to and include the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly they will perfect the four application of mindfulness
and they will perfect the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
having transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha
they will enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas and
also attain the extrasensory power of the bodhisattvas
through these extrasensory power of the bodhisattvas they will travel from buddhafield to buddhafield and
acquire a corporeal form through which they will refine the buddhafield and bring sentient being to maturity
they will bring sentient being to maturity
assume the kingly guise of a universal monarch or by become the king of a nation or
by become a member of the royal class tall as a great sāl tree or
by become a member of the priestly class tall as a great sāl tree
or else by assume the form of śakra by assume the form of brahmā or by assume the form of vaiśravaṇa
therefore ānanda if they honor venerate respect and make offering to this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they will accumulate the cause of all fruitional attribute
they will acquire all excellence
they will honor venerate respect and make offering to the tathāgata
they will honor venerate respect and make offering to the tathāgata
moreover ānanda those wish to behold in the buddha body of form and the buddha body of reality the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who reside in the innumerable world system of the ten direction and who be alive at present even now teach the sacred doctrine
should retain hold and master this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and extensively reveal it to other
should retain hold and master this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and extensively reveal it to other
having be attentive to it in the correct manner they will consequently behold the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who reside in all the innumerable world system of the ten direction
moreover ānanda the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
who wish actually to behold the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
should retain hold recite and master this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and be attentive to it in the correct manner
ānanda those in the past who become tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha also
attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
those who become the śrāvakas of those tathāgata also
attain the fruit of enter the stream dependent on this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and it be in the same way that they also attain the other fruit up to and include arhatship
those tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who will emerge in the future
and their śrāvaka who will also enter the stream and attain the other fruit
up to and include arhatship will all do so dependent on this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
those tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha who reside in the innumerable world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges and who be alive at present
even now teach the sacred doctrine
all attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
those śrāvaka of the present will also attain the fruit up to and include arhatship
and all those pratyekabuddha of the present who abide in the innumerable countless world system of the ten direction
and all those pratyekabuddha of the present who abide in the innumerable countless world system of the ten direction
will also attain individual enlightenment manifestly perfect buddhahood dependent on this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
it be because the three vehicle be extensively reveal in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
these attainment be all reveal in the manner of signlessness
and similarly they be reveal in the manner of non arising and non cessation
in the manner of non affliction and non purification
in the manner of non conditioning in the manner of non acceptance and non rejection
and in the manner of non standing non sit non grasping and non abandon
although they may be reveal accord to the conventional way of the world
in ultimate reality they be not like that
it be because this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be neither immanent nor transcendent
it be neither plain nor contoured it be neither flat nor uneven
it be neither with sign nor be it signless it be neither mundane nor supramundane
it be neither condition nor be it unconditioned it be neither virtuous nor non virtuous
it be neither specify nor non specified and it be neither past nor future nor present
then senior ānanda ask the blessed one
venerable lord do great-bodhisattva-being exclusively practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom or
do they also practice the other transcendent-perfection
the blessed one reply
ānanda great-bodhisattva-being practice all six transcendent-perfection
but they train without apprehend anything
they practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity but they do not apprehend this transcendent-perfection of generosity
they do not apprehend the dispenser of generosity and they do not apprehend the recipient of generosity
they practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline but they do not apprehend this transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
and in the same vein they practice the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
but they do not apprehend this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest
they do not apprehend those who possess wisdom and they do not apprehend those whose wisdom be confused
however this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy over all the other transcendent-perfection
it be thus that great-bodhisattva-being who dispense generosity perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy for those great-bodhisattva-being who keep the vow of ethical discipline
similarly this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy for those great-bodhisattva-being who keep the vow of ethical discipline
it be thus that they perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy for those great-bodhisattva-being who practice tolerance
it be thus that they perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy for those great-bodhisattva-being who undertake perseverance
it be thus that they perfect the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
the same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy for those great-bodhisattva-being who become absorb in the meditative concentration
it be thus that they perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
the same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have primacy for those great-bodhisattva-being who inspect phenomenon
it be thus that they perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the mother of the bodhisattvas because it generate all the attribute of the buddha
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the mother of the bodhisattvas because it generate all the attribute of the buddha
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be neither produce nor do it disintegrate because it be empty of intrinsic define characteristic

venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine repeat it in the three time and in its twelve aspect because it be neither subject to promulgation nor reversal
owe to the emptiness of essential nature and owe to the emptiness of ultimate reality i should not conceptualize in these way
when they think accordingly this be call the tolerance that understand phenomenon
when they cultivate comprehend and investigate these two mode of tolerance they accept that phenomenon be non arising
they continue to turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine which can not be turn by virtuous ascetic brāhmin priest god demonic force brahmā deity or anyone else
whichever lord buddha be alive and reside in the world system of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges and whichever buddha be alive and reside similarly in the world system of the other direction up to and include the intermediate direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
they will all offer praise and chant their eulogy say such and such a great-bodhisattva-being in such and such a world system have ride the great vehicle
and subsequently obtain the understanding of all the aspect of omniscience
having obtain the understanding of all the aspect of omniscience
that one turn in the world the wheel of the sacred doctrine which can not be turn by virtuous ascetic brāhmin priest or anyone else
śāradvatī­putra it be to that extent that great-bodhisattva-being be say to abide in the great vehicle
moreover śāradvatī­putra the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being entail the six transcendent-perfection
if you ask what these six be
they comprise the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom these be the six transcendent-perfection
if among they you ask what be the transcendent-perfection of generosity
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience give inner or outer object to those who desire they
and having do so then dedicate the merit of these gift for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being
that śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of generosity possess by great-bodhisattva-being
then if you ask what be the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience
adopt and practice correctly the path of the ten virtuous action and then also correctly introduce secure and establish other on the path of virtuous action
and do so without apprehend anything
this śāradvatī­putra be the unblemished transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline possess by great-bodhisattva-being
if you ask what be the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience themselves possess the excellent endowment of tolerance
and then also correctly introduce secure and establish other in tolerance
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of tolerance possess by great-bodhisattva-being
if you ask what be the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who have cultivate the mind endow with omniscience
be indefatigable with respect to the six transcendent-perfection
and also correctly introduce secure and establish sentient being in the six transcendent-perfection
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of perseverance possess by great-bodhisattva-being
if you ask what be the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
be themselves skillfully absorb in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption
yet they do so without apprehend physical form and in the same vein
they do so without apprehend any other phenomenon attribute or attainment up to and include omniscience
ānanda just as the shade of the tree of jambu­dvīpa with their different foliage different flower and different fruit
be reckon to be shade and apart from that no other detail or distinction be apprehensible in the same way
ānanda the five other transcendent-perfection which be acquire through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be dedicate to the attainment of omniscience and
also no other detail or distinction be apprehensible
then senior ānanda say to the blessed one
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be endow with great enlighten attribute in order that infinite enlighten attribute might be possess
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perfect all enlighten attribute and be endow with innumerable enlighten attribute
in order that infinite enlighten attribute might be possess
the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow
ānanda it be so it be just as you have say
then senior ānanda ask the blessed one
venerable lord if on the one hand there be some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
who commit this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write or have it commit to writing and
then make it into a volume of scripture hold it recite it or
similarly honor venerate respect and make offering to it with flower garland perfume unguent incense butter lamp powder religious robe clothing parasol victory banner ribbon and diverse musical sound and
in addition they be also attentive to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the correct manner and
if on the other hand there be other son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
having make it into a volume of scripture then bestow it upon other
which of these two would have the great merit
the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow
ānanda i will ask you a question and you should answer as good you can
ānanda in your opinion
which of these two have the great merit
those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
who continuously honor venerate respect and make offering to the relic of the tathāgata with flower and so forth up to and include ribbon and diverse musical sound
or those other son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who share a mustard seed size relic of the tathāgata with other so that they too receive a mustard seed size relic of the tathāgata and
then honor venerate respect and make offering to that relic with flower and so forth up to and include ribbon and diverse musical sound
senior ānanda say to the blessed one
venerable lord as i understand the meaning of the word speak by the lord
those who bestow a mustard seed size relic of the tathāgata on other will have much great merit
consider that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha become absorb in the adamantine meditative stability and
demonstrate the dissolution of the adamantine body
if one be to ask why
venerable lord it be because the root of virtue of any who make offering to a mustard seed size relic of the tathāgata who have pass into final nirvāṇa will not come to an end
rather all their suffering will come to an end
the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow ānanda it be so it be just as you have say
ānanda the merit of those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who commit this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write or have it commit to writing and then bestow it upon other out of joy in the sacred doctrine be much great than that of those who commit this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write or have it commit to writing and having make it into a volume of scripture then honor venerate respect and make offering to it with flower and so forth up to and include ribbon and diverse musical sound
moreover ānanda the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who resolutely wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment should honor venerate respect and make offering to this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which have just be teach
and they should retain hold recite and master it and be attentive to it in the correct manner
if you ask why
ānanda it be because great-bodhisattva-being also will attain emancipation through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
even the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha have attain emancipation through it
so it be ānanda that the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha or the vehicle of the śrāvaka
should honor venerate respect and make offering to this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with flower and so forth up to and include ribbon and diverse musical sound
then senior ānanda ask the blessed one
venerable lord when any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas teach
explain analyze elucidate and genuinely demonstrate this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
say come child of enlighten heritage you should earnestly apply this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
in that case venerable lord how much merit would those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage accrue on that basis
the blessed one reply
ānanda those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage would accrue much merit on that basis
ānanda do you think that if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to establish the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa in the fruit of enter the stream
in your opinion ānanda would those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage accrue much merit on that basis
yes they would venerable lord
the blessed one reply
ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to describe teach elucidate analyze and genuinely demonstrate these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to other
say come child of enlighten heritage you should retain hold master recite and be attentive to it in the correct manner
you should earnestly apply this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
they would have much great merit than those who establish sentient being in enter the stream
if you ask why
ānanda it be because those who enter the stream be distinguish through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in that case ānanda do you think that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage would accrue much merit on that basis
ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to establish as many sentient being as there be in all the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges in the fruit of enter the stream not to mention the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa and similarly not to mention the sentient being of the four continent not to mention the sentient being of the world system of a chiliocosm not to mention the sentient being of the world system of a dichiliocosm and ānanda not to mention the sentient being of the world system of a great trichiliocosm
yes they would venerable su­gata
the blessed one reply
ānanda if there be any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who describe teach elucidate analyze and genuinely demonstrate these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to other
the merit of those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage would be much great than the merit of the aforementioned son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who establish sentient being in enter the stream
they should be expect to become a revealer of the sacred doctrine or some other revealer one who be worthy of veneration or one who be renunciate in conduct
if you ask why
ānanda it be because the genuinely perfect buddha of the past indeed attain omniscience having train in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the tathāgata who will emerge in the future also
will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha who reside in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
and who be alive at present even now teach the sacred doctrine
have all attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment having train in this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
all the other learn renunciant śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha who have appear also
do so through having train in this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover all great-bodhisattva-being of the present who transcend the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
and enter into the maturity of the irreversible bodhisattvas
do so through having train in this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
also those who follow the vehicle of the śrāvaka
have attain and will attain arhatship through having train in this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha
have attain and will attain individual enlightenment through having train in this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
while those who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will also enter upon the maturity of the bodhisattvas through it
ānanda so it be that the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who wish to honor wish to venerate wish to respect and wish to make offering in the presence of the tathāgata with diverse flower and so forth up to and include ribbon and diverse musical sound
should commit this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to write or have it commit to writing
and then having make it into a volume of scripture honor venerate respect and make offering to it with diverse flower and so forth up to and include ribbon and diverse musical sound
consider this objective when i have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
i wonder whom i should honor venerate respect make offering to and rely upon
ānanda i do not see anyone like i or superior to i in the world replete with all their god human and antigod sentient being include divinity include māra include brahmā and include virtuous ascetic and brāhmin priest
and then it occur to i
i should honor venerate respect make offering to and rely upon the sacred doctrine which be calm abundant and through which manifestly perfect buddhahood be attain
ānanda if you ask what be that sacred doctrine it be this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
ānanda since even now i honor venerate respect make offering to and rely upon this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
ānanda the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who wish to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
should honor venerate respect and make offering to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with flower incense perfume garland unguent powder robe parasol victory banner and ribbon
should honor venerate respect and make offering to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with flower incense perfume garland unguent powder robe parasol victory banner and ribbon
those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who would enter the vehicle of the śrāvaka or those who would enter the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha
should also honor venerate respect and make offering to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with flower incense perfume garland unguent powder robe parasol victory banner and ribbon
it also go without say that
if you ask why
it be because it be through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that the bodhisattva have appear
through the bodhisattvas that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha have appear
and through the tathāgata that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha have appear
ānanda so it be that the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who be follower of the great vehicle
as well as the follower of the vehicle of the śrāvaka and the follower of the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha
should honor venerate respect and make offering with flower incense perfume garland unguent powder robe parasol victory banner and ribbon to this same transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in which they have all train and through which son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have attain be attain and will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
ānanda do you think that if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to establish all the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa as many as they be in the fruit of enter the stream
in your opinion ānanda
would those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage accrue much merit on that basis
would those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage accrue much merit on that basis
yes they would venerable lord yes they would venerable su­gata
the blessed one reply
ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to extensively describe teach analyze elucidate and genuinely demonstrate these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to other
say come child of enlighten heritage you should retain hold recite and master it and be attentive to it in the correct manner
you should earnestly apply this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
they would have much great merit than those who establish sentient being in enter the stream
if you ask why
ānanda it be because those who enter the stream be distinguish through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to establish the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa as many as they be in the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth in the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth in arhatship and in individual enlightenment
ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to extensively describe explain genuinely demonstrate and so forth these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to other
say come child of enlighten heritage you should retain this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
they would have much great merit than those who establish sentient being in those fruit
you should earnestly apply this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
if you ask why
ānanda it be because those fruit up to and include individual enlightenment be distinguish through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the same go for all the sentient being of the world system of the ten direction as many as the sand of the river ganges
and when you have train therein you will attain the attribute of omniscience
their merit would be equivalent
ānanda it be because all great-bodhisattva-being in the world system of the ten direction as many as they be from those who have first begin to set their mind on enlightenment and continue as far as those who abide on the tenth level
will attain emancipation through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
say come child of enlighten heritage you should train in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the same go for all the world system of the ten direction as many as the sand of the river ganges
moreover ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to establish all the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa as many as they be on the irreversible level
in your opinion ānanda
would those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage accrue much merit on that basis
yes they would venerable lord yes they would venerable su­gata
the blessed one reply
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom genuinely display the essential nature of all thing because it be the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
venerable lord how can bodhisattvas those who be on the vehicle of the bodhisattvas those who be on the vehicle of the śrāvaka or those who be on the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra just as they abide alongside the teacher and just as they pay homage to the teacher so they should do the same with respect to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
śāradvatī­putra it be because this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be itself the teacher
the teacher be not one thing and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom another
rather emptiness be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the nature of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be empty
it be owe to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be distinguish and similarly that the bodhisattvas the pratyekabuddha the arhat and
in the same vein all those of spiritual attainment down to and include those who have enter the stream to nirvāṇa be distinguish
it be owe to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that the path of the ten virtuous action be distinguish in the world
and similarly that the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration
the four formless absorption the five extrasensory power
the transcendent-perfection of generosity and the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and the emptiness of internal phenomenon along with the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be distinguish in the world
similarly it be owe to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that the ten power of the tathāgata be distinguish
along with the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and that the other attainment up to and include omniscience be distinguish
and on that account be no long subject to rebirth while they also correctly introduce secure and establish other in these meditative concentration immeasurable aspiration and formless absorption
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration possess by great-bodhisattva-being
if you ask what be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
definitively discern the nature of all thing and be without fixation on all thing
and having become unfixated on all thing then also correctly introduce secure and establish other in that definitive discernment of the nature of all thing
this śāradvatī­putra be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess by great-bodhisattva-being
śāradvatī­putra this be the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord be the transcendent-perfection of generosity mundane or be it supramundane
be this also the case with respect to the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord if the transcendent-perfection of generosity be mundane and that be also the case with respect to the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom then
venerable lord in what way could one perfect the transcendent-perfection of mundane generosity and likewise the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
what would be the point
mundane thing be condition and since anything that be condition be impermanent
how could something that be impermanent be perfect as a transcendent-perfection
also how could the transcendent-perfection of generosity be supramundane
if the transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be so they would not be create
how could something that be not create be perfect
the blessed one then address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection of generosity be both mundane and supramundane
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom also be both mundane and supramundane
śāradvatī­putra then ask what be the mundane transcendent-perfection of generosity
what be the supramundane transcendent-perfection of generosity
śāradvatī­putra those great-bodhisattva-being who have become liberal donor bequeath food to virtuous ascetic brāhmin the destitute wander mendicant forest dwell anchorite and to beggar who be in need of food
they offer drink to those in need of drink
and in the same vein they donate clothing incense garland unguent bed mat and home to those who be in need of they
they donate lodging to those who be in need of lodging they offer medicine to those in need of medicine they offer provision to those in need of provision
and similarly they offer appropriate human resource to beggar
and likewise they offer their son they offer their daughter they offer their wife and courtesan
and similarly they offer their head eye ear nose marrow hand limb and appendage
in do so they practice liberality while adhere to the ownership of property
ānanda if any son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be to extensively describe genuinely demonstrate and so forth these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to other
say come child of enlighten heritage you should retain this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
you should earnestly apply this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
child of enlighten heritage when you have train in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
you will attain the attribute of omniscience and
at that time you will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
in that case their merit would be much great than that
if you ask why
ānanda it be because the irreversible level of great-bodhisattva-being and the other attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
have also originate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the same go for all the world system of the ten direction as many as they be numerous as the sand of the river ganges
moreover ānanda if on the one hand some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
be to encourage all the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa as many as they be to acquire unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and
then be to describe genuinely demonstrate and so forth these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to they
when you have earnestly apply the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
you will train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
when you have train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
you will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
and if on the other hand someone be to teach genuinely demonstrate and so forth this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to those irreversible bodhisattva say
say come child of enlighten heritage you should retain this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
you should earnestly apply this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be teach
when you have earnestly apply it
you will gradually attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
in that case the latter would have much great merit than the former
the same go extensively for all the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
moreover ānanda if on the one hand there be some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage teach these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to those sentient being of jambu­dvīpa as many as they be and all those sentient being of the four continent as many as they be who could not be turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
thus should i swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood i should also lead forth those sentient being who have fall into the three inferior realm
thus should i swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood i should also lead forth those sentient being who have fall into the three inferior realm
there be some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage teach these noble meaning and noble word of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to one among they who would say
in that case the latter son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage would have much great merit
someone be to teach genuinely demonstrate and so forth this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to those irreversible bodhisattva
and if on the other hand
it be because the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being do not require even a single demonstration of the sacred doctrine
they be intent on perfect enlightenment and
can not be avert from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
whereas this one should be embrace because he or she be distressed at the suffering of being in cyclic existence and engage in act of great compassion
then senior ānanda say to the blessed one
venerable lord the more great-bodhisattva-being approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the aspect of emptiness from the emptiness of internal phenomenon up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
and similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the causal attribute from the four application of mindfulness up to and include the noble eightfold path
and similarly the more they wish to teach and grant instruction in the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and the more they wish to benefit sentient being with food clothing bed mat medication which cure ailment and other useful resource
the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who would benefit those bodhisattva attract they with the sacred doctrine and attract they with worldly need accrue much great merit than
the aforementioned son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who do not
if one be to ask why
venerable lord it be because i consider that those great-bodhisattva-being who teach and grant instruction in the transcendent-perfection of generosity and
similarly who teach and grant instruction in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
have much great merit
then the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow
ānanda you who encourage the son of enlighten heritage or the daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
ānanda you who encourage the son of enlighten heritage or the daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
well do
the sublime śrāvaka who wish to benefit sentient being should encourage great-bodhisattva-being who would attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they should assist and protect great-bodhisattva-being attract they with the sacred doctrine and attract they with worldly need
if you ask why
it be because the monastic community of the śrāvakas of the tathāgata originate from the bodhisattvas
while the vehicle of the pratyekabuddhas also originate from they
and the great vehicle also originate from they
ānanda if bodhisattva do not develop the mind set on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
great-bodhisattva-being would not train in the six transcendent-perfection
if they do not train in the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
because they would not have train in the six transcendent-perfection and the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if they do not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
there would be no unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment or the enlightenment of the pratyekabuddha or the enlightenment of the śrāvaka
ānanda it be because the bodhisattvas train in the six transcendent-perfection and in the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
that great-bodhisattva-being who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
will actually attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
then senior ānanda say to the blessed one
venerable lord as i understand the teaching speak by the lord
the precious jewel of the buddha the precious jewel of the dharma and the precious jewel of the saṅgha will not vanish from the world
as long as this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be active in the world venerable lord
likewise so long will the path of the ten virtuous action emerge in the world
so long will the four meditative concentration and similarly the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption emerge in the world
so long will the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration emerge in the world
so long will the causal and fruitional attribute from the four application of mindfulness up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha emerge in the world
likewise so long will the understanding of all phenomenon and the understanding of the aspect of the path emerge in the world
likewise so long will the royal class like a tall sāl tree the priestly class like a tall sāl tree and the householder class like a tall sāl tree emerge in the world
likewise so long will the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm emerge in the world
likewise so long will the god of all the other realm up to and include akaniṣṭha emerge in the world
likewise so long will those who have enter the stream those who be tie to one more rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth as well as arhat pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas and the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha all emerge in the world
so long subsequently will the pristine cognition of buddhahood emerge in the world
so long will the maturation of sentient being and the refinement of the buddhafield and so forth emerge in the world
so long will all non virtuous attribute be diminish
so long will all virtuous attribute that should be cultivate be perfect
so long will the god realm be enhance and the antigod realm be diminish
so long will the way of the buddha not be interrupt
so long will the way of the sacred doctrine and the way of the saṅgha not be interrupt
so long will the promulgation of the doctrinal wheel and so forth emerge in the world
the blessed one reply
ānanda it be so you have speak correctly
as long as the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be active in the world so long will the precious jewel of the buddha not vanish from the world
and in the same vein so long will all those other attribute up to and include the promulgation of the doctrinal wheel emerge in the world
if you ask why
ānanda it be because this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be of great benefit even when hear only minimally
let alone when it be retain hold recite master and attend to correctly
that be to say honor venerate respected and present with offering of flower fruit perfume unguent powder incense butter lamp parasol victory banner ribbon and diverse musical sound
if you ask why
ānanda it be because all those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage and the male and female god whose ear have hear this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will on the basis of this very root of virtue attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
ānanda it be because the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who emerge in the past along with their monastic assembly of śrāvaka
ndeed attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and pass into final nirvāṇa in the expanse beyond sorrow where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate having train in this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
also the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who will emerge in the future along with their monastic assembly of śrāvaka
will all attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and pass into final nirvāṇa in the expanse beyond sorrow where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate having train in this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
also all the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who reside along with their monastic community of śrāvakas in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
and who be alive at present even now teach the sacred doctrine
attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and will pass into final nirvāṇa in the expanse beyond sorrow where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate having train in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
ānanda it be because all the attribute of the aspect of enlightenment be gather in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
all the attribute of the buddha the attribute of the pratyekabuddha and
the attribute of the śrāvaka be also gather therein
all virtuous attribute be indeed attain therein and all thing be subsume therein
moreover ānanda you have revere i with benevolent action of body benevolent action of speech and benevolent action of mind
so it be that you have rejoice in have confidence in and pay homage to this my physical body while i be alive and present here and now
but after i have pass away you should rejoice have faith in and pay homage to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
ānanda after i have pass into final nirvāṇa
in any event you should not squander this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
after i have pass into final nirvāṇa in any event i shall entrust it to your hand twice or thrice so that not even a single syllable will vanish
ānanda you should know that for as long as this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be active in the world
so long will the tathāgata reside in the world
you should know that so long will the tathāgata teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being in the world
ānanda you should know that so long will sentient being behold the tathāgata and
inseparably hear the sacred doctrine from the tathāgata
you should know that so long will renunciate mode of conduct be maintain in the presence of the tathāgata
so long will being listen to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
so long will they commit it to write or have it commit to writing
and master describe retain hold recite teach and be attentive to it in the correct manner
honor venerate respecting make offering and praise it with flower garland perfume unguent incense butter lamp powder butter oil lamp robe parasol victory banner ribbon and many other useful necessity of offering
when the blessed one have speak these word
the great bodhisattva be maitreya and all the remain great-bodhisattva-being rejoice
along with senior su­bhūti senior śāradvatī­putra senior maudgalyāyana senior pūrṇa­maitrāyaṇī­putra senior mahākāśyapa senior mahākauṣṭhila senior kātyāyana senior ānanda
along with senior su­bhūti senior śāradvatī­putra senior maudgalyāyana senior pūrṇa­maitrāyaṇī­putra senior mahākāśyapa senior mahākauṣṭhila senior kātyāyana senior ānanda
and all the remain fully ordain monk and the complete assembly
as well as mundane being include god human antigod and gandharvas
manifest praise to the teaching speak by the blessed one
this complete the thirty third chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle the conclusion
this complete the noble great vehicle sūtra entitle the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if irreversible great-bodhisattva-being be endow with such enlighten attribute
what be the aspect of the path on which they abide and through which they then swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
what be the enlightenment of the lord buddhas
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti the six transcendent-perfection constitute the path of great-bodhisattva-being
the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment the three gateway to liberation
the fourteen aspect of emptiness the eight aspect of liberation
the nine serial step of meditative absorption and similarly the ten power of the tathāgata
the four assurance and all other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
constitute the path of great-bodhisattva-being
furthermore su­bhūti all thing
su­bhūti do you think that there be anything in which those great-bodhisattva-being who would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment having train their mind should not train
su­bhūti there be nothing at all in which great-bodhisattva-being should not train
if you ask why
it be because without training with respect to all phenomenon and attribute great-bodhisattva-being can not attain omniscience
senior su­bhūti then ask the blessed one
venerable lord if all thing be empty of inherent existence
how could great-bodhisattva-being differentiate between
attribute that be mundane or supramundane
contaminate or uncontaminated condition or unconditione the attribute of ordinary people
the attribute of those who have enter the stream the attribute of those who be tie to one more rebirth
the attribute of those who will no long be subject to rebirth the attribute of arhatship
or the attribute of individual enlightenment
up to and include the attribute of the genuinely perfect buddha
the blessed one reply
and indeed perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be acceptance that phenomenon be non arising what be its extent what be its cognition
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti for those great-bodhisattva-being not even the slight negative phenomenon will arise
there be no egotism or possessiveness they acquire the definitive tolerance of all formative predisposition which be dreamlike and the definitive tolerance of all other exemplar of the formative predisposition up to and include formative predisposition that be like a phantom
this therefore be call the acceptance that phenomenon be non arising
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the distinction or difference between the follow three kind of acceptance the acceptance which śrāvaka acquire with respect to the truth that phenomenon be non arising the acceptance which pratyekabuddha acquire with respect to the truth that phenomenon be non arising and the acceptance which bodhisattva acquire with respect to the truth that phenomenon be non arising
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being include the cognition and correct exertion of those who enter the stream
similarly the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being include the cognition and correct exertion of those who be tie to one more rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth and those who be arhat
the acceptance of great-bodhisattva-being include the cognition and correct exertion of those who be pratyekabuddha
this then be the distinction and difference between the acceptance of the śrāvaka the acceptance of the pratyekabuddha and the acceptance of the bodhisattvas
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such acceptance surpass all the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
abide in this acceptance they perfect the understanding of the aspect of the path
when they possess this understanding of the aspect of the path they will not lack the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment and similarly they will not lack the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness or of the five extrasensory power that arise through the maturation of past action
possess these extrasensory power and so forth they will travel from buddhafield to buddhafield and they will venerate those lord buddhas honor they with all resource and they will also bring sentient being to maturation and refine the buddhafield
consequently having bring sentient being to maturation and refine the buddhafield they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment by mean of instantaneous wisdom
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perfect the transcendent-perfection of tolerance which be without define characteristic
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom exert physical and mental perseverance maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike and maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like a phantom and so on
through physical perseverance they actualize miraculous ability
those endow with miraculous ability will traverse the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges and then venerate the lord buddhas and honor they with all resource
they will also work for the sake of sentient being and refine the buddhafield
through physical perseverance they will bring sentient being to maturation encourage they to unite with the three vehicle and establish they thereon
in addition one who possess mental perseverance which be include within the path and the branch of the path free from contaminant will perfect the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative equipoise the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and all virtuous attribute
great-bodhisattva-being who practice accordingly should perfect omniscience and having perfect that they will abandon all involuntary reincarnation through propensity
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have speak
all thing be empty of inherent existence
su­bhūti if all thing be apprehend not to be empty
great-bodhisattva-being would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti it be because all thing be empty of inherent existence
that great-bodhisattva-being will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti you have say that if all thing be empty of inherent existence
how could great-bodhisattva-being differentiate between
know whence and whereby anything arise and what constitute anything
attribute that be mundane or supramundane and so forth up to and include the attribute of genuinely perfect buddha
if su­bhūti sentient being know that all thing be empty of inherent existence
then great-bodhisattva-being would not undertake training with respect to all thing and attain omniscience
however su­bhūti it be because sentient being do not know that all thing be empty
that great-bodhisattva-being do undertake training with respect to all thing
and attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and that
after attain buddhahood they establish the sacred doctrine and
teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should consider such matter at the outset by train in the bodhisattva path thinking
there be nothing but fixation there be nothing at all that can be apprehend in term of inherent existence
since at this point i do not apprehend anything at all having consider the inherent existence of all thing
why should i be fixate on phenomenon
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being at present consider the inherent existence of phenomenon
they do not become fixate on anything at all
whether it be the six transcendent-perfection or the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
or the fruit of having enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
it be because they see that all thing be empty of inherent existence
and emptiness do not become fixate on emptiness
since they do not apprehend even emptiness how could they possibly be fixate on emptiness
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being abide without fixation on anything
after undertake and maintain this training they examine the conduct of all sentient being
when the thing in which those being be engage be examine
they be see to be grasp at that which do not exist
having see those sentient being engage in grasp at that which do not exist
they far reflect
these sentient being will easily be free from grasp at that which do not exist
then while maintain the six transcendent-perfection
these sentient being will easily be free from grasp at that which do not exist
through skill in mean they turn sentient being away from grasp at that which do not exist
and having turn they away encourage they toward the six attribute of the transcendent-perfection
instruct they as follow o sentient being you should dispense generosity and you will not be without resource
you should not make assumption on account of these resource
they lack even the slight essence
similarly you should maintain ethical discipline
you should practice tolerance
similarly you should undertake perseverance
similarly you should be absorb in the meditative concentration
similarly you should cultivate wisdom
but do not make assumption on account of these transcendent-perfection
they lack even the slight essence
similarly you should abide in the fruit of having enter the stream
but you should not make assumption on account of that
similarly you should abide in the other fruit up to and include arhatship
but you should not make assumption on their account
similarly you should abide in individual enlightenment
similarly you should abide in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
similarly you should abide in all the attribute of the buddha
teach and instruct those sentient being accordingly
the bodhisattva continue to practice the path of enlightenment
and they do not become fixate on anything at all
if you ask why
it be because owe to the emptiness of essential nature
they have no fixation on anything since all thing lack any essential nature by which they would become fixated upon which they would become fixated or which would become fixated
consequently great-bodhisattva-being practice the path of perfect enlightenment
but do not abide in anything at all
indeed they abide in a non abiding manner
they practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity but they do not abide therein
similarly they practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
but they do not abide therein
they become equipoise in the first meditative concentration
if you ask why
it be because the first meditative concentration be empty of its essential nature
while those who become absorb in it be also empty
and the aspect of it through which they become absorb be also empty
the same apply to all the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration
similarly they also become absorb in love kindness compassion empathetic joy and equanimity
but they do not abide therein
similarly they become absorb in the four formless absorption
the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative absorption
similarly they attain the fruit of having enter the stream
they attain all the other fruit up to and include arhatship
similarly they attain individual enlightenment
there be two reason
those fruit be without essential nature and they themselves be not satisfied merely by abide therein
indeed they think
similarly i should not abide in the other fruit up to and include the level of the pratyekabuddha
it be because they also think
i will undoubtedly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
those attribute of the low fruit be indeed subsume within it
so it be that great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
never develop any thought whatsoever apart from the mind of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
i should not attain the fruit of enter the stream and should avoid abide in it
from the first bodhisattva level up to the tenth bodhisattva level it be the same
they exclusively maintain the mind of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who without distraction advance courageously through body speech
and mind as appropriate be at all time accompany by the mind set on enlightenment
abide in this mind set on enlightenment
they be undistracted on the path of enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if all thing be non arising
then venerable lord how will enlightenment be attain by a path that be cultivate
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti it will not then be enlightenment attain by mean of a path that be not cultivate
su­bhūti it be not
well then be enlightenment attain by mean of a path that be neither cultivate nor not cultivate
venerable lord by what then will enlightenment be attain
su­bhūti enlightenment will not be attain by mean of the path
nor will it be attain by mean of that which be not the path
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because enlightenment itself be the path and the path itself be enlightenment
venerable lord if enlightenment itself be the path and the path itself be enlightenment
then great-bodhisattva-being would themselves have attain enlightenment
so why would the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha demonstrate the ten power and the other fruitional attribute
up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti do you think that the buddha attain enlightenment
no venerable lord
if one be to ask why
it be because the lord buddhas be themselves enlightenment
and enlightenment be itself the buddha
su­bhūti you have just ask whether the bodhisattva have themselves not attain enlightenment since enlightenment itself be the path and the path itself be enlightenment
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being after perfect the six transcendent-perfection
and similarly after perfect the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
and similarly the ten power of the tathāgata
the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion
and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment by mean of wisdom that be instantaneously endow with the adamantine meditative stability
and in the period after they have attain buddhahood
those bodhisattva will be reveal as tathāgata who have master all phenomenon
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being refine the buddhafield
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
and until their final rebirth great-bodhisattva-being purify the negativity of other include their negativity of body their negativity of speech and their negativity of mind
venerable lord what constitute the negativity of body which great-bodhisattva-being might have

moreover su­bhūti any notion of physical form and similarly any notion of feeling
and likewise any notion of the eye and any notion of the ear nose tongue body and mental faculty

for great-bodhisattva-being class as negativity of body negativity of speech and negativity of mind
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
have abandon all these aspect of negativity
they dispense generosity to those who need it
that be to say they give food to those who need food
they give drink to those who need drink
they give transportation to those who need transport
nd they give other gift include all human necessity whatsoever to those who wish for any other gift whatsoever up to and include all human resource
furthermore they also encourage other to acquire generosity induce and establish they therein
having concentrate all these root of virtue and after make common cause with all sentient being
with an attitude of confidence they then dedicate they so that the buddhafield might be refine
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being fill the world system of the great trichiliocosm with the seven precious thing
and present these as an offering to the three precious jewel
having make this offering they dedicate it with a joyful attitude say through these my root of virtue may this buddhafield be fashion of the seven precious thing
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being make offering to the reliquary stūpas of the tathāgata with divine and human music
having make these offering they then dedicate these root of virtue make common cause with all sentient being say through these my root of virtue may the sound of divine music always arise in this buddhafield
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being by fill the world system of the great trichiliocosm with divine perfume
constantly make offering to the tathāgata and the reliquary stūpas of the tathāgata
having make these offering they then dedicate these root of virtue make common cause with all sentient being say through these my root of virtue may the fragrance of divine perfume always arise in this buddhafield
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being make offering of food with a hundred flavor to the tathāgata bodhisattvas and pratyekabuddha as well as to the reliquary stūpas of the tathāgata and the śrāvakas of the tathāgata
and having make these offering they dedicate they say through these my root of virtue may i attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield and may all sentient being possess divine food with a hundred flavor
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being make offering of divine and human unguent to the tathāgata of the world system in the great trichiliocosm as well as to the reliquary stūpas of the tathāgata and to bodhisattvas pratyekabuddhas and the śrāvakas of the tathāgata
and having make these offering they dedicate they say through these my root of virtue may i attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddhafield and may all sentient being possess divine unguent
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being through the good intention that arise in their mind
make offering of the desirable attribute of the five sense to the tathāgata great-bodhisattva-being the pratyekabuddha and the śrāvakas of the tathāgata
and having make these offering they dedicate they say through these my root of virtue may i attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in this buddha field and through the good intention that arise in my mind may there be present the pleasant desirable attribute of the five sense which all sentient being possess
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom think
i should become equipoise in the first meditative concentration
i should encourage all sentient being also to assume the first meditative concentration
induce they and establish they therein
in the same vein
i should become equipoise in the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration
in the same vein i should induce they and establish they in the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption and so forth
similarly i should cultivate the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
i should also induce all sentient being and establish they in the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
induce all sentient being and establish they in the fourth meditative concentration and the rest
in that buddhafield where i will have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
all sentient being should not in any way lack the four meditative concentration
they should not lack the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption or the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will refine the buddhafield accordingly
by engage in this enlightenment all their wish will be fulfil
they themselves will possess all virtuous attribute
and they will encourage other also to assume all these virtuous attribute
induce they and establish they therein
they will reveal their own noble form to those sentient being
and also explain the reason for the emergence of their noble form
when sentient being see these form they will long to have they
and they will exclusively engage in conduct that be the cause of obtain such form
acquire the power of merit those sentient being will themselves eventually actualize such noble form
all of those sentient being whom the bodhisattvas have bring to maturity will be bear alongside they in those buddhafield
the sound of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness that emerge
will either be generate as internal sound through velar labial dental lingual and palatal articulation and so forth or else
the sound of emptiness signlessness and aspirationless will be stir by the external sound of the wind
indicate how phenomenon be essentially non arising that all thing be empty of all thing that they be signless because they be empty
and that be signless they be aspirationless
day and night such teaching of the sacred doctrine will emerge
stand sit lie down or walk
apart from that in those buddhafield that have not yet be refine
where the three inferior realm be conceive
where there be erroneous view where there be desire hatred and delusion
where there be śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha
where the hallmark of suffering impermanence emptiness and non self be conceive
and similarly where egotism possessiveness acquisition latent impulse ensnarement and
their fruit be conceive in such buddhafield those bodhisattva will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
and after attain enlightenment they will be praise by all the lord buddhas who reside in the world system of the ten direction
all sentient being who hear the name of this tathāgata
will themselves certainly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
when this tathāgata teach the sacred doctrine no sentient being will hesitate wonder whether this doctrine be in fact the doctrine
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because those sentient being will know that with respect to the real nature of phenomenon there be nothing at all that exist
su­bhūti it be in this way that great-bodhisattva-being refine the buddhafield
moreover su­bhūti when those sentient being who do not possess the root of virtue and
who have not develop the root of virtue under the guidance of the buddha bodhisattvas and śrāvaka
who have be mishandle by evil associate hear the sacred doctrine
they will be discourage by whatever aspect of their mistaken view the view of self or the nihilistic view prevail
that be to say they abide in the two extreme of eternalism and nihilism and so forth
they themselves be grip by the misapprehension that all thing exist and
they introduce other to this misapprehension
they harbor the notion that those who be not genuinely perfect buddha be genuinely perfect buddha and
they harbor the notion that those who be genuinely perfect buddha be not genuinely perfect buddha
they profess that which be not the doctrine to be the doctrine and they abandon the sacred doctrine
having abandon the sacred doctrine after they have pass away
they will fall into inferior realm and be reborn in the hell
thereupon great-bodhisattva-being will travel to those abode of the hell in order to assist those sentient being
free from their former negative view
those being will then pass away from the hell and be reborn equal in fortune to human being
those who be bear as such will be establish in the stable community that be intent on genuine reality
in any event they will not fall into inferior realm and
at the same time will be reborn in this buddhafield
in such way will they be establish
su­bhūti in any event once sentient being have be reborn in these buddhafield
great-bodhisattva-being will continue to refine the buddhafield
until all those sentient being be no long consume with doubt concern mundane supramundane contaminate uncontaminated condition unconditioned or any other phenomena and
until they definitively attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord will great-bodhisattva-being be stable in the community that be intent on genuine reality
will they be stable in the community of the śrāvakas or will they be stable in the community of pratyekabuddhas
venerable lord in which community will they be stable
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being will not be stable in the community of śrāvakas
they will not be stable in the community of pratyekabuddhas but
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being will be stable in the community of the genuinely perfect buddha
venerable lord be those great-bodhisattva-being who have first begin to set their mind on enlightenment say to be stable
or be those irreversible bodhisattvas in their final rebirth stable
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who have first begin to set their mind on enlightenment be indeed stable
those bodhisattvas who be irreversible and those in their final rebirth be also stable
venerable lord will great-bodhisattva-being who be stable in their intent on genuine reality be reborn among the denizen of the hell
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti do you think that one who be on the eighth level
one who have enter the stream one who be tie to one more rebirth
one who be no long subject to rebirth one who have attain arhatship or individual enlightenment will be reborn in the inferior realm
no venerable lord
the blessed one reply
similarly su­bhūti it be impossible that great-bodhisattva-being who from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and similarly maintain ethical discipline practice tolerance
undertake perseverance with respect to the acquisition of virtuous attribute
become absorb in the meditative concentration
cultivate wisdom and have abandon all non virtuous attribute and remain firm
should be reborn in the inferior realm or be reborn among long live god
it be impossible that they should be reborn among frontier tribesman who do not engage in virtuous act or among barbarous human being or
to be reborn among household or frontier tribesman who maintain wrong view
where the four assembly that be to say the assembly of fully ordain monk the assembly of fully ordain nun the assembly of layman and the assembly of laywoman be not find
it be impossible for they to be reborn in place where the word buddha the word dharma and the word saṅgha be unheard or where the word inaction and wrong view be hear
su­bhūti it be impossible that great-bodhisattva-being who have first begin to set their mind on enlightenment after enter upon the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment with high aspiration should adopt the way of the ten non virtuous action
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being be endow with many root of virtue
why be they reborn in the animal realm and
why do the tathā­gata disclose his own past life in the presence of the four assembly
where do those root of virtue go
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being do not assume a body that will be reborn in the animal realm due to non virtuous past action but
they assume a corporeal form by which they might be causally effective in order to benefit sentient being
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being be endow with skill in mean whereby they may take birth in the animal realm and mingle with assassin
do śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have this skill in mean which would enable they also to bring those creature and themselves to maturity in the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and make those assassin cease from cause further harm
for these reason su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be seize by great compassion
bring great compassion to its fulfilment
even though they be bear in the animal realm for the sake of sentient being
even though they be bear in the animal realm for the sake of sentient being
you should know that they be untainted by the defect of take birth in the animal realm
venerable lord maintain which virtuous attribute do great-bodhisattva-being acquire corporeal form that take birth in the animal realm
su­bhūti if you ask what be the attribute to be perfect by great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be the perfection of all virtuous attribute
therefore su­bhūti there be no virtuous attribute at all which should not be perfect by great-bodhisattva-being
commence exclusively from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they be seat at the focal point of enlightenment it be impossible for they to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment while any of these be unperfected
so it be su­bhūti that from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they be seat at the focal point of enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being should train in the perfection of all virtuous attribute
when they have train therein they will attain omniscience
they will abandon all afflict mental state and all involuntary reincarnation through propensity
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how be great-bodhisattva-being start from those who possess all positive attribute and continue as far as those who possess sublime pristine cognition bear in the inferior realm
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti do you think that the tathāgata be sublime and without contaminant
yes venerable lord it be so venerable su­gata it be so
the tathāgata be sublime and they be without contaminant
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti do you think that the tathāgata may emanate an animal body that take birth among the animal realm and
having emanate that form then engage in buddha activity
yes venerable lord they may do so
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti do you think that the tathāgata be creature of the animal realm
no venerable lord
similarly su­bhūti even great-bodhisattva-being who possess the uncontaminated pristine cognition of the sublime path may
in order to bring sentient being to maturity
assume at will such corporeal form by which they might bring to maturity any kind of sentient being among the five class of live being
su­bhūti do you think for example that an arhat can emanate as an arhat whose contaminant have cease
and having emanate that form then induce it to undertake the activity of an arhat
whereupon it would bring joy to the four assembly through these activity
yes venerable lord it be so
similarly su­bhūti even great-bodhisattva-being who possess sublime uncontaminated pristine cognition
may assume such corporeal form by which they might act on behalf of sentient being
those who have assume such form do not at all experience suffering
and they be untainted also by the corresponding defect
su­bhūti do you think that when an illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist
conjure the form of an elephant in the presence of a crowd of simple folk or
when he conjure the form of a horse or the form of a bull or when he conjure other form of living creature
do you think su­bhūti that those form conjure by the illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist actually turn into an elephant or that they turn into a horse bull or another living creature
no venerable lord
the blessed one reply
similarly su­bhūti even though great-bodhisattva-being who possess sublime uncontaminated pristine cognition
may reveal such corporeal form at will act on behalf of sentient being
they be indeed untainted by the feeling that they possess
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord since great-bodhisattva-being who possess sublime uncontaminated pristine cognition and
who may assume this or that corporeal form by which they be capable of act on behalf of sentient being
be greatly skilled in mean
venerable lord in which pure attribute do great-bodhisattva-being abide
when they then employ such skill in mean
su­bhūti they abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom when they employ such skillful mean
through this skill in mean though they may traverse all the world system in the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
and then act on behalf of those sentient being they do not hanker for they
if you ask why
it be because they do not apprehend anything at all by which or for which they would hanker
su­bhūti it be because all thing be empty of their essential nature
emptiness do not hanker and there be no one who hanker for emptiness
it be because emptiness do not apprehend emptiness
this su­bhūti be the emptiness of non apprehension
abide therein great-bodhisattva-being will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
when this doctrinal sūtra comprise the chapter on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be reveal
the mighty earth shake shake more intensely and shake with utmost intensity in six way
it tremble tremble more intensely and tremble with utmost intensity
when the eastern direction be high the western direction be low
thereupon śakra mighty lord of the god think
when the western direction be high the eastern direction be low
what be the basis of this question that senior śāradvatī­putra have ask
what be its context
when the southern direction be high the northern direction be low
śakra mighty lord of the god then ask senior śāradvatī­putra
venerable śāradvatī­putra what be the basis of this question that you have ask
senior śāradvatī­putra reply to śakra mighty lord of the god
moreover kauśika the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess by great-bodhisattva-being dominate the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly it dominate the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
kauśika the five low transcendent-perfection resemble one who be bear blind
kauśika great-bodhisattva-being who have acquire the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom owe to their skillful mean
last as long as the sacred doctrine itself endure
as well as the root of virtue possess by the lord buddha along with his monastic community of śrāvakas
when the northern direction be high the southern direction be low
have concentrate and subsume the root of virtue possess by the lord buddhas of the past future and present commence from when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment and
when the centre be high the periphery be low
when the periphery be high the centre be low
many hundred billion trillion god cause their divine cymbal to reverberate through the firmament above
make common cause with all sentient being
they then dedicate these root of virtue for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment so this be the basis of the question i ask
ten million god cause a cascade of divine flower blue lotus night lotus and white lotus to fall
the blind find their sight the deaf find their hearing
the insane find their mindfulness the distracted find their equipoise
the sound of a trillion cymbal indeed resound without having be play
and those of the pratyekabuddha and the root of virtue possess by all other sentient being apart from they who be engage in the great vehicle
many marvelous phenomenon such as these occur in the world
god and human numerous as the particle of the buddhafield develop the mind set on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
sentient being numerous as the particle of jambu­dvīpa comprehend the sacred doctrine that be to say the immaculate pure and untainted eye of the sacred doctrine with respect to all thing
bodhisattvas as numerous as the sand of the river ganges accept that phenomenon be non arising
many sentient being attain the meditative stability the mnemonic incantation and the bodhisattva level
an innumerable countless number of sentient being pass away from the three inferior realm
and be reborn among the god and human
the entire assembly also beheld throughout the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges the lord buddha who teach this doctrinal sūtra on the chapter of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which have be request by the fully ordain monk śāradvatī­putra and su­bhūti in its entirety without omit or add any word and syllable
this be the second promulgation of the doctrinal wheel by the lord buddhas in the world which be comprehend in all buddhafield by an astonishing innumerable countless inconceivable and incomparable number of sentient being
such be the word that arise in the presence of the maṇḍala of the assembly throughout all these buddhafield
this complete the thirty second chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle the attainment of manifest enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
think i be give they be receive
o i be without miserliness i be a donor i give alm o i give everything i respect the lord buddhas
i practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
i having give this gift dedicate it for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being and without apprehend anything
venerable lord be great-bodhisattva-being who properly realize the define characteristic of phenomenon in this way irreversible
through this my gift may all sentient being attain happiness in this lifetime may they attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of reality that be beyond sorrow and where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
however in give their gift they be tie by three fetter
yes they be su­bhūti
venerable lord what be the attribute of the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
what be their indication what be their sign
how should we properly understand the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti
that which have be explain as the level of ordinary people
the level of the śrāvaka the level of the pratyekabuddha the level of the bodhisattvas and
the level of the tathāgata all these level be identical with the real nature of phenomenon
which be unchanging non conceptual non dual and indivisible
the real nature of those great-bodhisattva-being engage with this real nature of phenomenon
but their real nature do not conceive of the real nature of phenomenon
they engage with the real nature of phenomenon absolutely non conceptually
and when they have do so and understand the real nature of those phenomena
they do not then reject it doubt that this be not the real nature of phenomenon
rather they think this real nature be absolutely unique it be the expanse of reality and the maturity of reality
they do not prattle incoherently
they speak word that be entirely meaningful without speak meaninglessly
they do not look upon what other have and have not do
hey endeavour to speak well
su­bhūti one should know that great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be irreversible
venerable lord through which attribute indication and sign be great-bodhisattva-being reveal to be irreversible
the blessed one reply
all phenomenon be without attribute without indication and without sign
if all phenomenon be without attribute without indication and without sign
then from what phenomenon have great-bodhisattva-being turn away when they be reveal to be irreversible
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being have turn away from physical form and
similarly when they have turn away from feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
those great-bodhisattva-being be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being have turn away from the level of ordinary people
have turn away from the level of the śrāvakas and
have turn away from the level of the pratyekabuddha they be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being have not turn away from the transcendent-perfection of generosity and
similarly when they have not turn away from the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
when they have not turn away from the emptiness of internal phenomenon and
not turn away from the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity and
in the same vein when they have not turn away from all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
at that time those great-bodhisattva-being be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti in the presence of virtuous ascetic and brāhmin who be non buddhists the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being do not say that those virtuous ascetic and brāhmin know what should be know see what should be see or discern the correct view
therefore the bodhisattva do not cause they to doubt the discipline of the sacred doctrine which have be excellently teach
on the contrary that view would be impossible for they
nor do they maintain the supremacy of their ethical discipline and ascetic discipline
they do not fall into wrong view
they do not hold they to be pure owe to their sacred thread and auspicious ceremony
they do not pay homage to strange god
they do not offer they garland perfume unguent butter lamp incense powder clothing parasol victory banner and ribbon
nor do they consider do so
su­bhūti the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being who possess these attribute indication and sign
will not be reborn among low social class or among inferior class
that be to say they will not be reborn among the outcaste among the scavenger or garbage collector among the reed flute maker or among other inferior class and so on up to and include in the eight unfavorable condition for practice the sacred doctrine
nor will they assume the physical form of a woman necessarily endure great hardship
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign
be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible

but they cultivate it without apprehend anything
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible dispense the gift of the sacred doctrine comprise the various scriptural category
they think may the wish of all sentient being be fulfil by mean of this gift of the sacred doctrine
make common cause with all sentient being they dedicate that gift of the sacred doctrine toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
but they make this dedication without apprehend anything
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible
have no doubt indecision or hesitation with regard to profound phenomenon and attribute
venerable lord why do great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible have no doubt indecision or hesitation with regard to profound phenomenon and attribute
the blessed one reply
great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible do not consider anything at all with respect to which they might have doubt indecision or hesitation
that be to say they do not consider physical form feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness
and in the same vein they do not consider the attribute and attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment

they be also without thought of hostility toward all sentient being
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible
always undertake physical action imbue with love kindness
and similarly they undertake verbal action imbue with love kindness and mental action imbue with love kindness
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
do not instinctively maintain the five obscuration
if you ask what these five be
they do not instinctively maintain longing for sensual pleasure harmful intention dullness and sleepiness agitation and regret and hesitation
be in every respect free from all latent impulse
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible move about they do so in accordance with the application of mindfulness
they move about mindfully they exclusively walk stand sit and lie down mindfully
they do not put their foot on the ground impulsively and they do not raise their foot above the ground impulsively
rather they put their foot on the ground entirely mindfully and they raise their foot above the ground entirely mindfully
moreover su­bhūti the condition of the robe belong to great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible be never unkempt but always clean and free from bad odor
moreover su­bhūti the condition of the robe belong to great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible be never unkempt but always clean and free from bad odor
they themselves have few ailment and they be free from dust and stain
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti the body of great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible
be without the eighty thousand kind of animalcule which be present within the human body and consume it
if you ask why
su­bhūti their root of virtue surpass all world and be supreme in all the world
for this reason the body of those bodhisattva be without those kind of animalcule
su­bhūti the more those root of virtue of great-bodhisattva-being increase
the more will those great-bodhisattva-being assume physical verbal and mental purity
they can withstand cold heat hunger thirst sun wind and bite insect
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the physical purity of those great-bodhisattva-being
what be their verbal purity
what be their mental purity
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti the more those root of virtue of great-bodhisattva-being increase
the more will the physical deformity and crookedness the verbal deformity and crookedness and the mental deformity and crookedness of these great-bodhisattva-being be purify in accordance with those root of virtue
insofar as they physically practice the three mode of excellent conduct
verbally practice the four mode of excellent conduct and
mentally practice the three mode of excellent conduct
the body of those great-bodhisattva-being will be purify
those who possess physical purity verbal purity and mental purity
their speech will be purify and their mind will be purify
transcend the level of the śrāvaka and also the level of the pratyekabuddha
they indeed enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas but
they do not yet actualize the finality of existence
su­bhūti you should know this indeed to be the physical purity the verbal purity and the mental purity of those bodhisattva
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign
be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible
be not attract to profit veneration and eulogistic verse
they be not attract to religious robe alm bed and seat
but they assume and maintain the twelve ascetic virtue
never cultivate thought of miserliness and
they never cultivate thought of degenerate morality
thought of indolence thought of distraction or thought of delusion
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be steadfast
they respectfully listen to the sacred doctrine from other and
whatever they hear they integrate all of it with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they also know entirely without effort and dependent on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom those activity which be mundane
and these too they integrate with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not consider anything at all that be not integrate within the expanse of reality but they do consider that all these phenomena be integrate with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
su­bhūti if the evil māra be to conjure up the eight great hell with their sentient denizen in the presence of those great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible
and if he be also to reveal in each of these hell with their sentient denizen many thousand of bodhisattvas and many hundred of thousand of bodhisattvas
and if he be to conjure up and reveal they be burn cook and boil by the fire of hell experience unbearable strong and excruciating suffering
and even if he be then to say to those bodhisattva
these great-bodhisattva-being have be exclusively foreordain by the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha to be irreversible in their attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
but they have all be reborn among these denizen of the hell
alas you too who have be foreordain by the tathāgata to be irreversible in your attainment of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment will end up as denizen of the hell
alas right now you should reject this cultivation of the mind that be set on enlightenment and you will consequently be release from these sentient hell
and subsequently you will not be reborn here but on pass away you will proceed to the high realm
su­bhūti there be no possibility and no chance for the mind of those great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible to be alienate in the hell
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because they well realize the define characteristic of the sacred doctrine to be that the fruit of non virtuous action be unpleasant and
because the tathāgata endow with great compassionate spirituality the treasure of the sacred doctrine
do not speak falsely inasmuch as they profess to benefit all live being
su­bhūti there be no possibility and no chance for that to happen
for this reason it be impossible for those great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible to be reborn among the denizen of the hell or among the animal or among anguished spirit
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti the evil māra approach in the guise of a virtuous ascetic might say
you should perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
that you should perfect the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and that you should consequently attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
all of that you have misheard
you should confess once again all these error
you should confess once again all your rejoicing in the root of virtue of the past future and present tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and their śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they became establish in the sacred doctrine
you should reject they once again you and they be mistaken
alas you should once again confess and reject those root of virtue
if you act accord to my word you will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
alas you should once again confess and reject those root of virtue
that which you have hear be not the word of the buddha it be poetic fabrication
but since that which i be teach you be genuine it be the word of the buddha
kauśika just as those who be bear blind whether they number a hundred a thousand or a hundred thousand
can not set out on a road or enter a hamlet town city or country without a guide
and they be incapable and inadequate have no way to move in the same way
unguide by the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom all of they will be separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
so that they will have no opportunity to set out on the path associate with perfect enlightenment from one to the next or to enter the citadel of omniscience
having abandon that they will achieve the power of absorption in consummate perfection without define characteristic
and turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine in the three time and in its twelve aspect
though this turning of the wheel the world system of the great trichiliocosm will shake shake more intensely and shake with utmost intensity in six way
they will rock rock more intensely and rock with utmost intensity
and they will quake quake more intensely and quake with utmost intensity
all world system of the great trichiliocosm will be permeate with luminosity
the word of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha will resonate cause they to be hear
and those sentient being who be present in the world system of the great trichiliocosm will indeed listen
all of they will attain emancipation through the three vehicle
su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection of perseverance with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow be esteem in this manner
abide in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance great-bodhisattva-being will perfect all the attribute of the buddha and attain omniscience
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative stability maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike
and they perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative stability maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like a phantom and so on
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative stability maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate from those that be dreamlike to those that be like a phantom
su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration and then they will achieve and maintain all the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration
they will also achieve and maintain love kindness compassion empathetic joy and equanimity alongside the formless absorption from the sense field of infinite consciousness up to and include the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
they will cultivate the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
leave aside the meditative stability of the tathāgata the meditative stability that resemble lightning the authentic meditative stability and the adamantine meditative stability they will also achieve and maintain whichever other meditative stability be appropriate the meditative stability of the śrāvaka the meditative stability of the pratyekabuddha or any other category of meditative stability having suffuse they all with their body
but they will not relish these meditative stability or the fruit of these meditative stability
if you ask why it be because great-bodhisattva-being understand that the define characteristic of those meditative stability have an essential nature of non entity
just as anything without define characteristic can not relish an attribute that be without define characteristic
what you may ask be the three
they comprise the notion of self the notion of other and the notion of the act of giving
and just as a non entity can not relish a non entity they do not relish these meditative stability
and so they will not be reborn in the world system of desire in the world system of form or the world system of formlessness through any of these meditative stability
this act of give gift when tie by these three fetter
śāradvatī­putra be call the transcendent-perfection of mundane generosity
if you ask why it be call the transcendent-perfection of mundane generosity
it be because those who practice in such mundane way do not move beyond and transcend the mundane
for that reason it be designate as mundane
what you may ask be the supramundane transcendent-perfection of generosity
it be the purity of the three sphere of subject object and their interaction
if you ask why it be because they do not apprehend those world system and so they do not apprehend anything at all neither anyone enter into absorption nor that by which they would enter into absorption
since all thing be non apprehensible they will perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration that be without define characteristic
in this context the mind that be precede by the great compassion of great-bodhisattva-being do not apprehend the dispensing of gift
through the transcendent-perfection of meditative stability they will transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha
if on that occasion these bodhisattva be disturb and if they be doubtful and hesitant
you should know that these bodhisattva will not have be foreordain by the tathāgata to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they would not abide on the irreversible level
su­bhūti if on the other hand when the evil māra oppose their aspiration
these great-bodhisattva-being be not disturb be neither doubtful nor hesitant
and do not depend on other for the transcendent-perfection of generosity or for the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and similarly for the attribute and attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment then
have no confidence in his word have no confidence in other
su­bhūti you should know that these great-bodhisattva-being will not turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti just as an arhat endow with the cessation of contaminant never have confidence in anyone else because he directly perceive phenomenon and
be not captivate even by the evil māra let alone by other in the same way
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible do not have confidence in anyone else and
they can not be crush by any of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha or even by the evil māra
they will not turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they do not have confidence in anyone
since they do not progress through faith even in the tathāgata
how could they have confidence in other virtuous ascetic brāhmin sectarian vagabond wandering mendicant or the evil māra
that would be impossible
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because these great-bodhisattva-being do not consider any physical form in which they should have confidence
similarly they do not consider any feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness in which they should have confidence
similarly they do not consider any real nature of physical form real nature of feeling real nature of perception real nature of formative predisposition or real nature of consciousness in which they should have confidence
in the same vein they do not consider any real nature of the attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience in which they should have confidence
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti the evil māra approach in the guise of a fully ordain monk might say to these bodhisattvas
this be the conduct associate with cyclic existence but
not the conduct of a bodhisattva
alas right here in my presence you should put an end to suffering and
he would reveal to these bodhisattva a counterfeit path to perfect enlightenment
a counterfeit path that be indeed subsume in the mundane conduct associate with cyclic existence
or else he would reveal the contemplation of a skeleton or the contemplation of a blue black corpse a putrefied corpse a bloated corpse a bloody corpse or a devoured corpse or else he would reveal love kindness compassion empathetic joy or equanimity or else he would reveal the first meditative concentration or the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration or else he would reveal the four formless absorption
senior one through this path and through this earnest application
you will attain the fruit of one who have enter the stream and
you will attain the other fruit up to and include arhatship and individual enlightenment
alas right here in my presence you should put an end to suffering
subsequently you will not experience those suffering associate with conduct that pertain to cyclic existence
alternatively if you be disillusion with this physical incarnation or
if you be think not to hold on to it
you should purify the sense field right here and now
su­bhūti if even when he speak such word the bodhisattva be undisturbed and undistracted think in addition
this monk who reveal to i a counterfeit path which will not actualize the fruit of enter the stream and will not actualize the other fruit up to and include the fruit of arhatship and which will not even actualize the fruit of individual enlightenment be useful to i in many way
and if they far rejoice think this monk who expound attachment to i be useful to i in many way know the circumstance of this attachment i should train in all the three vehicle
then the evil māra know that they be rejoice might say
o child of enlighten heritage
you wish to see great-bodhisattva-being who have honor the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha numerous as the sand of the river ganges with robe food clothing mat medication and other resource
as well as those who have cultivate the transcendent-perfection of generosity and similarly cultivate the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the presence of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha numerous as the sand of the river ganges
and those who have venerate the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha numerous as the sand of the river ganges
for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being should abide on the path of perfect enlightenment by practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity and
similarly by practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
by practice the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
similarly by practice the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation and in the same vein the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
but even those great-bodhisattva-being who abide in accordance with the exegesis impart by the buddha have practice in that manner and engage in union with they
have not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
since those who have be teach in this way those who have be instruct in this way and those who have be train in this way have not attain omniscience
you should consider how you could possibly attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if when the evil māra say such word the mind of those great-bodhisattva-being be not alienated and frightened
and if in addition they rejoice think this monk who expound to i the attachment through which even the fruit of enter the stream will not be actualize and through which the other fruit up to and include individual enlightenment will not be actualize be useful to i in many way
then the evil māra know that the mind of those bodhisattva be not discourage
might instantaneously conjure up in that very place a multitude of monk and say
these monk be exclusively arhat free from afflict mental state who have attain the cessation of contaminant
they previously embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but instead they remain as śrāvakas
therefore you should consider how could you possibly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
therefore you should consider how could you possibly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
even when confront with such revelation great-bodhisattva-being would think alas this be the evil māra reveal a counterfeit path
this be a phantom and they would think
great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and
they do not regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha and
if in addition they think
there be no possibility and no chance that
great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
who practice the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
who practice the application of mindfulness and
who practice the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
will fail to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess all such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible would think
bodhisattva being who do not lack the six transcendent-perfection teach by the tathāgata
who also encourage sentient being to assume the six transcendent-perfection secure and establish they therein and
whose mind be endow with omniscience be reveal to be irreversible
those bodhisattva who know and recognize the deed of māra will not degenerate from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask what constitute the deed of māra
they entail excessive attachment and longing for the object of the five sense
along with apathy regard the transcendent-perfection
su­bhūti they would think great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord turn away from what be great-bodhisattva-being reckon to be irreversible
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being turn away from the notion of physical form
they be reckon to be irreversible
in the same vein
similarly great-bodhisattva-being who turn away from the notion of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be reckon to be irreversible
great-bodhisattva-being who turn away from the notion of the sense field the notion of desire hatred and delusion the notion of the sixty two aspect of false view the notion of the transcendent-perfection of generosity the notion of the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the notion of the emptiness of internal phenomenon the notion of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity the notion of the application of mindfulness and similarly the notion of the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha the notion of the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha and the notion of the attainment up to and include omniscience be all reckon to be irreversible
if you ask why su­bhūti
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible have enter upon the maturity of the bodhisattvas with respect to all phenomenon which be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
they apprehend nothing at all even to the extent of an indivisible atomic particle and
because they do not apprehend anything at all they do not condition anything at all
because they do not condition anything at all they do not produce anything at all
therefore great-bodhisattva-being who have accept that phenomenon be non arising be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti the evil māra might approach great-bodhisattva-being and dissuade they say
empty of intrinsic define characteristic
this omniscience be equal to space of the essential nature of non entity and
phenomenon be also equal to space of the essential nature of non entity and
with regard to thing that be equal to space
whose essential nature be non entity and emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
there be nothing apprehensible which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood by which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attain and in which manifestly perfect buddhahood would be attain
since all these phenomenon be equal to space
of the essential nature of non entity and empty of intrinsic define characteristic
you will be afflict and futile in your effort to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
for such teaching be reveal to be the work of māra
this be not the teaching of the genuinely perfect buddha
child of enlighten heritage you should reject those attention
then you will not endure hardship for long you will not suffer and you will not be distressed
on hear those word son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage should reflect
those word which would separate i from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be the work of māra
although all thing be indeed equal to space
of the essential nature of non entity and empty of intrinsic define characteristic
they be not know see or comprehend as such by sentient being
therefore i should don the armor that be equal to space whose essential nature be non entity and which be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
to attain omniscience manifestly perfect buddhahood
and reveal to sentient being the sacred doctrine of emancipation from cyclic existence
i should establish they in the fruit of enter the stream
in the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
in the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth and in arhatship
i should establish they in individual enlightenment
i should establish they in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being should be steadfast
when listen to these sacred doctrine
their mind should not be distract their mind should not be captivate
when those whose mind be steadfast undistracted and not captivate practice the six transcendent-perfection
they will enter upon the maturity of the bodhisattvas
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord can reversible great-bodhisattva-being be call irreversible and
can irreversible bodhisattva be call reversible
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti reversible bodhisattva may be call irreversible
irreversible bodhisattva may be call reversible
su­bhūti then make the following request
venerable lord how may reversible bodhisattva be call irreversible
and how may irreversible bodhisattva be call reversible
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who have turn back from the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha be irreversible bodhisattva these su­bhūti may be call irreversible
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who have not turn back from the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha be reversible
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who have not turn back from the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha be reversible
these su­bhūti may be call reversible
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who have turn back from the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha be irreversible bodhisattva
these su­bhūti may be call irreversible
su­bhūti you should know this to be the define characteristic of the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign
great-bodhisattva-being who possess those attribute indication and sign
can not be turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment by the evil māra
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible become absorb at will in the first meditative concentration
and similarly they become absorb at will in the second third and fourth meditative concentration
in the same vein
they become absorb at will in the formless absorption up to and include the absorption in the cessation of perception and feeling
similarly they become absorb in the four application of mindfulness
and they become absorb in all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
similarly they become absorb in emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
they actualize the five extrasensory power
but while they may become absorb at will in the four meditative concentration
they will not be reborn by the power of those meditative concentration
similarly while they may become absorb in the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption
they will not be reborn through their power
similarly while they cultivate the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
they will not regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
similarly they do not actualize and hold on to the fruit of cessation that be to say the formless absorption up to and include absorption in the cessation of perception and feeling
at will they may assume the incarnation that they wish
and having assume these incarnation they act for the benefit of sentient being
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible do not attach importance to physical form
they do not attach importance to sign
they do not attach importance to their assembly
they do not attach importance to generosity
they do not attach importance to ethical discipline
they do not attach importance to tolerance
they do not attach importance to perseverance
they do not attach importance to meditative concentration
they do not attach importance to wisdom
they do not attach importance to the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration or the formless absorption
they do not attach importance to the extrasensory power
they do not attach importance to the application of mindfulness
and in the same vein
they do not attach importance to the buddhafield that be to be refine
they do not attach importance to the sentient being who be to be bring to maturity
they do not attach importance to behold the buddha and they do not attach importance to the root of virtue
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because those great-bodhisattva-being
consider that all phenomenon be empty of intrinsic define characteristic and equal to space and
they do not consider anything through which they should attach importance or with respect to which they should attach importance
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because those great-bodhisattva-being
consider that all phenomenon be empty of intrinsic define characteristic and
that they be equal to space
it do not apprehend the giver nor do it apprehend the recipient this absence of giving and the absence of rejoicing in the ripen impact of give śāradvatī­putra
be call the purity of the three sphere of subject object and their interaction
moreover śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being offer gift to all sentient being and even after make their gift they practice liberality toward those same being but they do not apprehend those sentient being
they do not consider the recipient they do not even rejoice in the ripen impact of their giving
although they also dedicate their gift for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment they do not consider even the slight indication of anything
this śāradvatī­putra be call the transcendent-perfection of supramundane generosity
if you ask why it be call the transcendent-perfection of supramundane generosity
it be because it go beyond the mundane it be superior to the mundane and transcend the mundane
for that reason it be call the transcendent-perfection of supramundane generosity
in the same vein the abide mode of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline be mundane and its non abide mode be supramundane
what have already be say for the transcendent-perfection of generosity should be fully apply here and also for the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
the abide mode of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be mundane and its non abide mode be supramundane
śāradvatī­putra just as great-bodhisattva-being perfect the mundane and supramundane transcendent-perfection of generosity so it be that they perfect the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this indeed śāradvatī­putra be the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being their great armor and the maturity of the bodhisattvas
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha through the transcendent-perfection of meditative stability
the blessed one reply su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being have be well train in the emptiness of internal phenomenon
and they have be well train in all the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic but they do not apprehend anything at all apart from those aspect of emptiness
since they abide in accordance with those aspect of emptiness wherever they abide they do not apprehend anything at all that would attain the fruit of enter the stream or the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth or the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth or arhatship or individual enlightenment
they even consider omniscience to be emptiness
endow with those aspect of emptiness they will transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the level of the pratyekabuddha and enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
venerable lord what be the immaturity of the bodhisattvas and what be the maturity of the bodhisattvas
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti all apprehension constitute the immaturity of the bodhisattvas the absence of all apprehension constitute the maturity of the bodhisattvas
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being have be well train in the emptiness of internal phenomenon
venerable lord what be apprehension what be non apprehension
su­bhūti physical form constitute apprehension for great-bodhisattva-being
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness constitute apprehension for great-bodhisattva-being
similarly the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty constitute apprehension for bodhisattvas
similarly sight sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon constitute apprehension for bodhisattvas
in the same vein all causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience constitute apprehension for bodhisattvas
non apprehension denote the state in which these phenomenon be non dynamic that be to say in which no phenomenon be apprehensible no physical form feeling perception formative predisposition or consciousness
and similarly no eye ear nose tongue body or mental faculty
and similarly no sight sound odor taste tangible or mental phenomenon
and similarly no sensory element of the eye sensory element of sight or sensory element of visual consciousness
and similarly no sensory element of the ear sensory element of sound sensory element of auditory consciousness sensory element of the nose sensory element of odor sensory element of olfactory consciousness sensory element of the tongue sensory element of taste sensory element of gustatory consciousness sensory element of the body sensory element of tangible sensory element of tactile consciousness sensory element of the mental faculty sensory element of mental phenomenon or sensory element of mental consciousness
and similarly no four application of mindfulness
and in the same vein no other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
and similarly no ten power of the tathāgata
and in the same vein no other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and similarly no attainment up to and include omniscience
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because whatever be the essential nature of physical form it be indescribable
similarly whatever be the essential nature of feeling whatever be the essential nature of perception whatever be the essential nature of formative predisposition and whatever be the essential nature of consciousness be indescribable
in the same vein whatever be the essential nature of all the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience these be all indescribable
since bodhisattvas indeed perfect all the meditative concentration and formless absorption but will not be reborn on account of these experience how could they possibly be reborn on account of desire hatred and delusion
that would be impossible
there be no possibility for they to actualize the karma of fall into cyclic existence with its five class of live being by assume any rebirth or actualize any karma
on the contrary having precisely establish that formative predisposition resemble an illusion they always work for the benefit of sentient being
but on account of the essential nature they do not apprehend sentient being nor do they even apprehend illusion
since they apprehend neither sentient being nor illusion they may indeed bring sentient being to maturation and refine the buddhafield
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
and then turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine which be without apprehension
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be dreamlike and maintain the five acquisitive psycho physical aggregate which be like a phantom and so on
definitively perceive all thing in the manner of a dream and all thing in the manner of a phantom and so on
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom how do they definitively comprehend that all thing be like a dream and that all thing be like a phantom and so on
the blessed one reply su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not dream dream and they be not dreamer of dream
they do not hear echo and they be not hearer of echo
and they do not see optical aberration and they be not viewer of optical aberration
similarly they do not see and they be not viewer of mirage magical display or phantom
if you ask why it be because dream and similarly echo optical aberration mirage magical display or phantom be the erroneous misconception of ordinary people
whereas su­bhūti the arhat who be free from contaminant do not dream dream nor be they dreamer of dream
similarly they do not see phantom nor be they viewer of phantom and so forth
similarly the pratyekabuddha the bodhisattvas and the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha do not dream dream and they be not dreamer of dream and so on
they do not see phantom and they be not viewer of phantom
that would be impossible
o venerable lord if there be many bodhisattva who be engage in the pursuit of enlightenment
there be few who could respond in the manner of an irreversible great-bodhisattva-being whether they abide on the purificatory level or the non purificatory level
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti it be so
if you ask why
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being of whom the level of irreversible pristine cognition have be foreordain be few in number
those who have be foreordain will respond correctly
one should know that they have cultivate the root of virtuous action
those great-bodhisattva-being will not be captivate by the whole world with its god human and antigod
thereupon senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one venerable lord what be the sameness of great-bodhisattva-being the sameness in which great-bodhisattva-being should train
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti the emptiness of internal phenomenon constitute the sameness of great-bodhisattva-being
similarly the emptiness of external phenomenon
and su­bhūti in the same vein the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity constitute the sameness of great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti all these aspect of emptiness constitute the sameness of great-bodhisattva-being having train in these great-bodhisattva-being will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
venerable lord be those great-bodhisattva-being who undertake training in order to terminate physical form and become detached from they so that they cease and do not arise actually train in omniscience
similarly be those who undertake training in order to terminate feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and become detached from they so that they cease and do not arise actually train in omniscience
venerable lord be those great-bodhisattva-being who undertake training in order to terminate the six transcendent-perfection and become detached from they so that they cease and do not arise actually train in omniscience
the same go for the application of mindfulness and so on and in the same vein be those great-bodhisattva-being who undertake training in order to terminate the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and become detached from they so that they cease and do not arise actually train in omniscience
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti do you think that the real nature of physical form can be terminate or abandon or do it cease
no venerable lord
su­bhūti do you think that the real nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness can be terminate or abandon or do it cease
no venerable lord
su­bhūti do you think that the real nature of the six transcendent-perfection can be terminate or abandon or do it cease
no venerable lord
su­bhūti do you think that the real nature of the four application of mindfulness and in the same vein the real nature of all other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha can be terminate or abandon or do it cease
then the blessed one say
su­bhūti whether those great-bodhisattva-being be go out return standing sit or lie down they go and come stand up sit and lie down in accordance with the four acceptable norm of behavior because they be attentive to omniscience
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti even if great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible dwell as householder
through skill in mean they dispense their generosity toward sentient being having acquire the five desirable attribute of the sense for the sake of sentient being
that be to say they dispense food and drink to those who need food and drink and so on
they dispense whatever thing be useful to humankind
they practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity and they also encourage other to assume the transcendent-perfection of generosity
they also praise and rejoice in their transcendent-perfection of generosity
the same also go for the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
this complete the ninth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle teaching
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord when it be say that they should don the great armor what be the extent of the great armor that they should don
the blessed one then address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should don the armor of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and similarly they should don the armor of the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they should don the armor of the application of mindfulness and don the armor of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
they should don the armor of the emptiness of internal phenomenon and don the armor of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly they should don the armor of the ten power of the tathāgata
and they should don the armor of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they should don the armor of the attainment up to and include omniscience
they should don the armor of the buddha body then they will illuminate the world system of the great trichiliocosm
in the same manner they illuminate the world system of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
similarly they illuminate the world system of the other direction up to and include the intermediate direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
having permeate all direction with light they cause the world system of the great trichiliocosm to shake to shake more intensely and to shake with utmost intensity and in six way
in the same manner they cause the chiliocosm extend from the eastern direction up to and include the intermediate direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges to shake to shake more intensely and to shake with utmost intensity and in six way
it be by mean of this illumination that great-bodhisattva-being don the armor of the transcendent-perfection of generosity and of the other attribute up to and include the buddha body
they emanate the world system of the great trichiliocosm as a natural expanse of beryl
and having do so they emanate the array of a universal monarch
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible dwell as householder
they fill jambu­dvīpa with diverse precious thing emanate through the power of their miraculous ability
and offer gift to the lord buddhas in the same vein
they fill the world system of the great trichiliocosm and so forth with diverse precious thing and offer gift to the lord buddhas
yet they do not indulge in those sensual pleasure and they always practice chastity
they be clean and without bad odor
they never despise anyone else or have contempt through which they would come to dislike other
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti think that these great-bodhisattva-being will soon attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the yakṣa vajrapāṇi will always follow behind irreversible great-bodhisattva-being without interruption in order to guard and protect they
just as he follow behind i the unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddha
in the same vein
up to five hundred attendant of the vajra family will always follow behind without interruption in order to guard and protect they
in this respect they can never be harm by human and non human
in conformity with the sacred doctrine they can never be rival by any god demon brahmā or anyone else in the world
until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment their mind will not be distract from attention to enlightenment
their sense faculty will never be deficient
that be to say
their sense faculty from the sense organ of the eye to the sense organ of the body will never be deficient
they will never lack the five supramundane faculty
if you ask what these five be
they comprise the faculty of faith the faculty of perseverance the faculty of mindfulness the faculty of meditative stability and the faculty of wisdom
they will be saintly being
venerable lord in what way be great-bodhisattva-being saintly being
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti the mind of those great-bodhisattva-being
will never be distract from perfect enlightenment by the five false imagination and the five obscuration
therefore su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being be saintly being
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being who always have their mind set on enlightenment
will in no way whatsoever concoct secret spell medication and compound medication which attract woman nor will they engage in anything with a nature that be harmful to other
even for the sake of their life they will not engage in any skillful mean that attract woman
they will not attract man woman boy or girl with miraculous fortune telling claim you will have a son you will have a daughter your family line will be break you will have a long life you will have a short life
and they will not bring ruin upon anyone at all
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being do not consider any sign of sentience in thing that be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
it be impossible for they to engage in negative action
therefore their livelihood be entirely pure
let alone sign of wrong livelihood
moreover su­bhūti i shall now disclose the attribute indication and sign which when they be possess reveal great-bodhisattva-being to be irreversible
so listen well and pay attention to they i will explain they
please do so venerable lord say senior su­bhūti and he listen to the blessed one
the blessed one then speak as follow
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not lack the mode of attention to perfect enlightenment for which reason
they do not preoccupy themselves with the psycho physical aggregate
nor do they preoccupy themselves with the sensory element and the sense field
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because those great-bodhisattva-being have excellently cultivate the emptiness of the psycho physical aggregate the sensory element and the sense field and
they have attend excellently
they do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of king
it be because excellently abide in emptiness they do not consider anything at all as inferior or superior
they do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of robber
it be because with respect to all thing which be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
they do not consider anything at all that should be acquire or steal
they do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of aggressive conflict
it be because excellently abide in the emptiness of inherent existence
they do not consider anything at all in term of minority and majority
they do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of the buddha
it be because excellently abide in the emptiness of all thing they do not consider anything at all that be to be accumulate
they do not preoccupy themselves with the talk of town city village market and palace circle
it be because excellently abide in the emptiness of space
they do not consider anything at all that be to be attract or not attract
they do not preoccupy themselves with talk about animal
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because excellently abide in the finality of existence
they do not consider anything at all that be to be attract or not attract and they do not consider anything at all that be to be increase or diminish
they do not preoccupy themselves with talk about the self sentient being living creature live and the other superimposed notion of a subject up to and include knower and viewer
it be because they do not consider any thing that be without life and without sentience
they do not preoccupy themselves with talk of diverse matter
it be because excellently abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they never lack attentiveness associate with omniscience
practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity they never preoccupy themselves with miserliness
similarly practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
they do not preoccupy themselves with degenerate morality
practice the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
they do not preoccupy themselves with agitation or anger
practice the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
they do not preoccupy themselves with indolence
practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration they do not preoccupy themselves with distraction
practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not preoccupy themselves with stupidity
conduct themselves in the emptiness of all thing
they wish for the sacred doctrine
and also act for the benefit of sentient being
conduct themselves in the expanse of reality
they do not praise the diversity of phenomena
those who want to have the lord buddhas and great-bodhisattva-being as a spiritual mentor listen to the sacred doctrine and then
devote themselves to teach that sacred doctrine to those sentient being who follow the vehicle of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha
having devote themselves to teach that sacred doctrine
they encourage those sentient being to acquire unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and establish they therein
in order to behold make offering to and venerate the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
they be consequently reborn in those world system where they dwell and be present
and they see those tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
that be to say they abide day and night attentive to perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because after the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being have generate the attention associate with the world system of desire
abide in the way of the ten virtuous action
they be generally reborn through the power of their aspiration in those buddhafield where the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha have manifest and be visible
similarly after they have cultivate the first meditative concentration and
after they have cultivate the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration
they be reborn through the power of their aspiration in those buddhafield
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign be reveal to be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being who have practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
practice the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and then
practice the other transcendent-perfection and the aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity
and then practice the application of mindfulness
and in the same vein
practice all the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
do not hesitate in any respect whatsoever wonder whether they be irreversible or reversible
if you ask why
it be because they have no hesitation regard their own level
and since they have no hesitation regard their own level
they thoroughly comprehend all thing
it be because they do not consider anything at all that be irreversible or not irreversible even to the extent of the tiny particle
su­bhūti just as a person who have enter the stream have no doubt and no hesitation regard the fruit of those who have enter the stream
in the same way su­bhūti the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being also have no doubt and no hesitation regard that irreversible level
abide on that irreversible level
they also refine the buddhafield and they bring sentient being to maturity
know too the deed of māra that have arise and occur
they do not proceed under the influence of māra ’s deed
rather having understand all the deed of māra they overwhelm and disperse they
su­bhūti just as a man who have commit an inexpiable crime
will never be separate from the thought associate with that inexpiable crime even until death and
he can not banish the thought of that inexpiable crime by any mean whatsoever and
his obsessive thought will pursue he even until death
the thought of that inexpiable crime will pursue he so that
in the same way su­bhūti the irreversible thought of the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
be indeed establish on the irreversible level and can not waver
the world with its god human and antigod can not turn they away from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
it be because those irreversible great-bodhisattva-being have transcend the world with its god human and antigod and enter into the maturity of the genuine nature
abide on their own level
they have reach genuine perfection through the extrasensory power of the bodhisattvas and
so they refine the buddhafield and also bring sentient being to maturity
they travel from buddhafield to buddhafield
in order to behold pay homage to and indeed listen to the sacred doctrine from the lord buddhas
in those buddhafield they cultivate the root of virtue in the presence of the lord buddhas and their monastic community of śrāvaka
and they question counter question and venerate those lord buddhas
comprehend also those deed of māra that be reveal to be distinct from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they can even meditate on the deed of māra which might have arise and occur as be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
through skill in mean they integrate they in the finality of existence and they never have doubt indecision or hesitation regard their own level
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because they have no doubt indecision or hesitation regard the finality of existence and they do not conceive of the finality of existence as singular or dual
know this even after they have pass away they will not generate thought on the level of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha
su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being with regard to phenomenon which be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
do not consider anything at all that be subject to arise cessation affliction or purification
su­bhūti when those great-bodhisattva-being have pass away
they will think i will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
but they will not think i will not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti it be because unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who abide on their own level can not be alienate
they can not be overpower by any sentient being
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being who abide accordingly
be endow with pristine cognition that can not be captivate
su­bhūti if the evil māra be to approach the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being in the guise of the buddha
he might say o child of enlighten heritage
in this lifetime you should attain arhatship in which all afflict mental state have cease
you be not foreordain by the lord buddhas to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
you have not accept that phenomenon be non arising whereby the lord buddhas would foreordain that you will attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
you do not possess the attribute the indication and the sign endow with which it be foreordain that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment will be attain
if even on hear these word great-bodhisattva-being be not discourage not intimidate not alienated and not terrified
then su­bhūti these great-bodhisattva-being should know that they have be foreordain by the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti it be because they consider that they themselves possess the attribute endow with which the lord buddhas foreordain that unsurpasse genuinely perfect enlightenment will be attain
su­bhūti even if the evil māra be to approach great-bodhisattva-being in the guise of a buddha
say you should become a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
what would you do with unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and
then encourage they through many such reason to acquire the level of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha
these great-bodhisattva-being would think
this one be not the tathāgata nor be he a śrāvaka of the tathāgata
alas on the contrary this be māra or a man emanate by the evil māra
who have approach i
encourage i to acquire the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
do not encourage great-bodhisattva-being to acquire the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddha
do not encourage great-bodhisattva-being to acquire the level of the śrāvakas or the level of the pratyekabuddha
if they be to think this su­bhūti
you should know that great-bodhisattva-being endow with such attribute indication and sign be irreversible
su­bhūti if māra or a man conjure up by the evil māra be to approach great-bodhisattva-being while they be read aloud and recite the most extensive discourse teach by the tathāgata
and say o child of enlighten heritage
those sūtra that you be follow be not the most extensive discourse teach by the tathāgata
nor be they teach by the śrāvaka
rather they be teach by māra and they be teach by other heretic
these be not the real most extensive discourse
these great-bodhisattva-being would know alas this be māra or a man conjure up by the evil māra who would separate i from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and dissuade i from the path of enlightenment
in that case su­bhūti these great-bodhisattva-being should know that they have be foreordain by the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha of the past to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
those great-bodhisattva-being should know that they abide on the irreversible level
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because they possess and manifest the attribute indication and sign of the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
and having emanate the array of a universal monarch they give food to all those in need of nourishment
in the same vein they dispense other benefit to sentient being include appropriate human resource
and similarly they give drink clothing garland incense unguent home lodging lamp and so on up to and include medicine
and having make such gift they then teach sentient being the sacred doctrine that be endow with the six transcendent-perfection
those sentient being too on hear sacred doctrine will never commit transgression
nd will never be separate from the six transcendent-perfection until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti it be to that extent that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
su­bhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist stand at a crossroad in the presence of a large gathering of people be to offer food to those in need of nourishment and dispense all those other aforementione gift up to and include the appropriate human resource
you think su­bhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have dispense any gift to any sentient be
su­bhūti so it be that when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly in the real nature of these attribute they do train in omniscience
they train in the six transcendent-perfection
they train in the four application of mindfulness
and in the same vein they train in all other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly will manifestly attain the transcendent-perfection of all training
they can not succumb to demonic force or to the god within the realm of demonic force
they will swiftly attain the level of an irreversible bodhisattva
they will abide within the perceptual range of their respective tathāgata
they will also be establish in the protective sacred doctrine
they will also refine their respective buddhafield
they will also bring sentient being to maturity
they will also train in great loving kindness and great compassion
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly will turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine repeat it in the three time and in its twelve aspect
they will lead sentient being hundred of billion trillion in number to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
they will ensure that the lineage of the tathāgata will not be interrupt
they will also open the gate to immortality
they will establish innumerable countless immeasurable sentient being in the three vehicle
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly will train in omniscience
su­bhūti inferior sentient being on account of their volition can not undertake this training but great-bodhisattva-being who wish to liberate all sentient being from cyclic existence do undertake this training
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly will never be bear among the denizen of the hell they will not be bear among animal in the world of yama or in the domain of anguished spirit they will not be bear among frontier tribesman they will not be bear among inferior class of being among the destitute or among servile class
they will never be blind hunchbacke crippled or mutilate they will not have impaired vision
they will not be too tall they will not be too short nor will they be sallow in complexion
they will not become killer of living creature and so on
they will not resort to mistaken view
they will never sustain themselves through wrong livelihood
they will not acquire anything that be inauthentic
they will not acquire anything but the sacred doctrine
they will not acquire degenerate morality
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly will never be bear among the long live god
this be their skill in mean if they possess skill in mean they will become equipoise in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration the meditative stability and the formless absorption but they will not take rebirth in the world system of form and formlessness due to these influence
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being possess skill in mean it be reveal in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that they may become equipoise in the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration the meditative stability and all the formless absorption but on arise from these state their skill in mean ensure that they will not be reborn in the high realm through the influence of those meditation nor will they be will bear among the long live god
moreover su­bhūti the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
relinquish even their own life for the sake of acquire the sacred doctrine
but they do not relinquish the doctrine
it be because they think i will make offering to the lord buddhas of the past the future and the present since they have acquire the sacred doctrine i will also acquire their sacred doctrine
if you ask for the sake of which doctrine great-bodhisattva-being relinquish even their life the doctrine that they will not relinquish
it be this su­bhūti the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha teach that all phenomenon be empty
some foolish person
this be not the sacred doctrine this be not the vinaya
this be not the teaching of the teacher this be not the path that progress to perfect enlightenment
may contradict this and counterattack say
however su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being relinquish even their life for the sake of this sacred doctrine
think i too will be reckon among the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who will emerge in the future
i too will be foreordain to attain that
for the sake of this doctrine i will relinquish even my life
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being
consider this objective relinquish even their own life for the sake of the sacred doctrine
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign
should know that they be irreversible
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who be irreversible
do not harbor doubt or hesitation with regard to the doctrine when the doctrine of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be be teach
they do not have even a single moment of indecision with regard to that doctrine
having hear that doctrine they retain it
having retain it they do not squander it until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
it be because they have acquire the mnemonic incantation that enhance retention
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord by acquire which mnemonic incantation do the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being not squander the sūtra speak by the tathā­gata
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti by master the mnemonic incantation of the inexhaustible cornucopia and
similarly by master the oceanic seal absorb all thing and the mnemonic incantation of the lotus array
the irreversible great-bodhisattva-being
after hear the sūtra speak by the tathā­gata will not squander they
venerable lord be it after hear the sūtra speak by the tathā­gata alone that great-bodhisattva-being become free from doubt and hesitation and
additionally retain and be attentive to they in the prescribed manner but
not so in the case of those that be explain by the śrāvaka
not so in the case of those explain by the god
not so in the case of those explain by the nāgas and
not so in the case of those explain by the yakṣas
or else be it that having hear the sūtra explain by antigod garuḍas kiṃnara and mahoraga too
they become free from doubt and hesitation and additionally retain they
su­bhūti these great-bodhisattva-being be without doubt without hesitation and without indecision regard all the language sound term explanation and statement employ by sentient being
immediately after hear those language sound term explanation and statement they retain they and do not squander they
this be because having master the above mnemonic incantation
they know their meaning exactly as they be
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who possess such attribute indication and sign should know that they be irreversible
this complete the thirty first chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle irreversibility
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom observe and study production and disintegration with respect to the five psycho physical aggregate while train in these three gateway to liberation
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom correctly perceive physical form
they correctly perceive the real nature of physical form that physical form neither arise from anywhere nor do they cease anywhere
if you ask how they correctly perceive physical form
they see that physical form be utterly porous or utterly fallacious just as a mass of foam be insubstantial
if you ask how they perceive the arising of physical form
inasmuch as physical form neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere
they correctly perceive the non arising of physical form from anywhere and their non go to anywhere
so it be that they perceive the arise of physical form
if you ask how they perceive the cessation of physical form
but be subject to consummation and disintegration so it be that they perceive the cessation of physical form
if you ask how they correctly perceive the real nature of physical form
inasmuch as the real nature of physical form be subject neither to arise nor cessation neither come nor go
be neither afflict nor purify and be neither enhance nor diminish
so it be that they correctly perceive the real nature of physical form
if you ask how they correctly perceive feeling
they correctly perceive that feeling be utterly ripe and utterly painful resembling for example the fleeting condition of a bubble in water
inasmuch as feeling neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere but

be subject to consummation and disintegration
so it be that they correctly perceive the cessation of feeling
inasmuch as the real nature of feeling be neither afflict nor purify and be neither enhance nor diminish
so it be that they correctly perceive the real nature of feeling
if you ask how they correctly perceive perception
it be the case that they correctly perceive perception to resemble for example a mirage which deceive those who crave water despite the fact that in a mirage actual water be non apprehensible
inasmuch as perception neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere but
emerge through false imagination and be conventionally designate
so it be that they correctly perceive the arising of perception
so it be that they correctly perceive the cessation of perception
inasmuch as the real nature of perception be neither afflict nor purify and be neither enhance nor diminish
so it be that they correctly perceive the real nature of perception
if you ask how they correctly perceive formative predisposition
it be the case that they correctly perceive formative predisposition to resemble a plantain tree in which the actual core be non apprehensible when the outer layer be peel away
inasmuch as formative predisposition neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere but
but emerge through false imagination
so it be that they correctly perceive the arise of formative predisposition
inasmuch as formative predisposition neither arise from anywhere nor do they go anywhere but
be subject to consummation and disintegration
so it be that they correctly perceive the cessation of formative predisposition
inasmuch as the real nature of formative predisposition neither arise nor cease
be neither afflict nor purify and be neither enhance nor diminish
so it be that they correctly perceive the real nature of formative predisposition
if you ask how they correctly perceive consciousness
just as an illusionist stand at a crossroad
in the presence of a crowd of common folk may deceive childish person by conjure up the four corps of an army the elephant corp the cavalry corp the chariot corps and the infantry corp
so it be that they correctly perceive consciousness
inasmuch as consciousness neither arise from anywhere nor do it go anywhere but
emerge through formative predisposition and be also generate through the condition of formative predisposition
so it be that they correctly perceive the arising of consciousness
if you ask how they correctly perceive the sensory element
they correctly perceive that the sensory element of the eye be empty of inherent existence
similarly they correctly perceive that the sensory element of sight and the sensory element of visual consciousness be empty of inherent existence
in the same vein
they perceive that all the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness be empty of the inherent existence of mental consciousness and the other sensory element
so it be that they correctly perceive the sensory element
if you ask how they correctly perceive the sense field
they correctly perceive the six internal sense field to be empty of the six internal sense field
similarly they correctly perceive the six external sense field to be empty of the six external sense field
so it be that they correctly perceive the sense field
if you ask how they correctly perceive the four noble truth
they correctly perceive that the define characteristic of the truth of suffering be harm
the define characteristic of the truth of the origin of suffering be production
the define characteristic of the truth of cessation be peace
and the define characteristic of the truth of the path be emancipation
they correctly perceive that liberation ensue from the last two noble truth but
they also correctly perceive that liberation do not ensue from the former two noble truth
if you ask how they correctly perceive dependent origination
they correctly perceive that it neither arise nor cease that it be neither nihilistic nor eternalistic that it be neither confine to a single meaning nor be its meaning manifold that it neither come nor go and that it be free from conceptual elaboration and calm
so it be that they correctly perceive dependent origination
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be to investigate phenomenon that be so different from one another in this manner
would the expanse of reality not be disrupt
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti the expanse of reality would be disrupt if there be any extraneous phenomena exist apart from it but
su­bhūti there be indeed no apprehensible phenomenon apart from the expanse of reality
if there be any such apprehensible phenomena
the expanse of reality would indeed be disrupt
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because there be nothing which the tathāgata bodhisattvas pratyekabuddhas and the śrāvakas of the tathāgata apprehend outside the expanse of reality
since there be nothing to apprehend there be nothing to explain
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
should train in the expanse of reality which be indivisible and undisrupted
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord in what have those great-bodhisattva-being who train in the expanse of reality actually train
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train in the expanse of reality have train in all phenomenon
su­bhūti it be because all phenomenon be gather in the expanse of reality
venerable lord why be all phenomenon gather in the expanse of reality
su­bhūti whether the tathāgata have appear or whether they have not appear
the expanse of reality which include all phenomenon itself abide indivisibly
su­bhūti the expanse of reality indeed comprise all thing
attribute that be virtuous and non virtuous specify and non specified contaminate and uncontaminated mundane and supramundane and condition and unconditioned
the expression all phenomenon designate all these
venerable lord if all phenomenon be the expanse of reality then
venerable lord how should great-bodhisattva-being train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom

venerable lord since such false imagination do not exist in this expanse of reality
if one be to ask why
venerable lord would great-bodhisattva-being not then engage or identify with erroneous view
venerable lord it be because these false imagination do not exist in the expanse of reality
physical form indeed be not the expanse of reality nor be feeling perception formative predisposition consciousness the sense field of the eye or all the other sense field up to and include the sense field of mental phenomenon and nor be the sensory element of the eye and all the other sensory element up to and include the sensory element of mental consciousness
however the expanse of reality do not exist apart from physical form feeling perception and formative predisposition
nor do it exist apart from consciousness
physical form themselves be the expanse of reality
and the expanse of reality be itself physical form
similarly consciousness and so forth be themselves the expanse of reality and
the expanse of reality be itself consciousness and so forth
this refrain should be extensively apply to all phenomenon
just as it have be apply to they in previous context
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have say
all these false imagination do not exist in the expanse of reality
physical form indeed be not the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality exist separate from physical form
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not the expanse of reality
nor do the expanse of reality exist separate from consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate
rather the very nature of physical form be the expanse of reality
and the expanse of reality be itself physical form
similarly the very nature of the other aggregate up to and include consciousness be the expanse of reality
and the expanse of reality be itself consciousness and the rest
this refrain should be extensively apply to the sense field just as it have be juxtapose here in the context of the psycho physical aggregate
su­bhūti if great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
be to see anything apart from the expanse of reality
then they would not be intent on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
this be why su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not see anything apart from the expanse of reality
therefore when all phenomenon be know to be the expanse of reality
all those nameless phenomenon can then be denote by the symbolic convention of name as follow these be physical form these be feeling these be perception these be formative predisposition this be consciousness
su­bhūti if an illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist be to empower some visible form and then exhibit it in a diversity of other form in the form of a man the form of a woman the form of an elephant horse or bull or in the diverse form of a pleasant garden a pleasant river a pleasant pool or a pleasant tree in the presence of a crowd of common folk and

senior śāradvatī­putra these be the meditative stability of great-bodhisattva-being abide in which they will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
then senior su­bhūti say to senior śāradvatī­putra
o senior śāradvatī­putra the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha of the past have foreordain that great-bodhisattva-being who abide in these abovementioned meditative stability will attain unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
one should know that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who be presently alive reside in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges also make prophecy with regard to those great-bodhisattva-being
without consider any of those meditative stability these bodhisattva be absorb in meditation
i have be absorb in meditation
i be absorb in meditation
i will be absorb in meditation
they do not make assumption on account of those meditative stability think
all these conceptual imagination be absent and do not arise
then senior śāradvatī­putra say to senior su­bhūti
senior su­bhūti should one then know that great-bodhisattva-being who abide in these meditative stability have be foreordain by the tathāgata of the past and be be foreordain by the tathāgata who be alive at present reside in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
senior śāradvatī­putra that be not the case
if you ask why
it be because senior śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the meditative stability and great-bodhisattva-being be not distinct from one another
rather the bodhisattvas themselves be the meditative stability and the meditative stability be themselves the bodhisattvas
the bodhisattva the meditative stability and this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be without duality and they be inseparable
however kauśika when the five low transcendent-perfection start with the transcendent-perfection of generosity have be acquire through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
these five transcendent-perfection will be endow with vision
indeed it be because they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that these five transcendent-perfection be designate as transcendent-perfection
then śakra mighty lord of the god address senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
however venerable śāradvatī­putra be these five transcendent-perfection not designate as transcendent-perfection when they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
venerable śāradvatī­putra you say that it be because they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
that these five transcendent-perfection be designate as transcendent-perfection
similarly be these five transcendent-perfection not designate as transcendent-perfection when they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline when they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection of tolerance when they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection of perseverance or when they be acquire by mean of the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
kauśika he reply it be so it be just as you have speak
however great-bodhisattva-being who abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
fully perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and similarly they fully perfect the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
so it be kauśika that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be designate as beyond these five low transcendent-perfection
it be designate as the foremost the good the most excellent the unsurpassed and the high
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord how should the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be actualize
the blessed one reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize due to the non actualization of physical form
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize due to the non actualization of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize due to the non actualization of the transcendent-perfection of generosity and the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize due to the non actualization of the understanding of all phenomenon and the non actualization of the understanding of the aspect of the path and of omniscience
venerable lord how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to be actualize due to the non actualization of physical form
how be transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to be actualize due to the non actualization of all these other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize because physical form be not actualize because they do not arise because they be non apprehensible and because they do not disintegrate
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and in the same vein all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be not actualize because they do not arise because they be non apprehensible and because they do not disintegrate
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should be actualize due to the non actualization of the emptiness of internal phenomenon and in the same vein of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity as well as the application of mindfulness and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord when the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be actualize in that manner what thing be attain
nothing at all be attain
this be why it may be style the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord what be the thing that be not attain
the blessed one reply
virtuous phenomenon and non virtuous phenomenon will not be attain
similarly mundane phenomenon supramundane phenomenon contaminate phenomenon uncontaminated phenomenon censurable phenomenon non censurable phenomenon condition phenomenon and unconditioned phenomenon will not be attain
if you ask why
śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not establish anything at all in an apprehending manner
for this reason nothing at all be attain
then śakra mighty lord of the god ask the blessed one
venerable lord do the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom not attain and not apprehend even omniscience
kauśika it be so it be just as you have speak
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not attain and do not apprehend even omniscience
venerable lord in what way do the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom not attain and not apprehend even omniscience
if in that same place he be then to exhibit a diversity of mat or clothing
and even exhibit a diversity of flower garland and a diversity of food delicacy savory cook food and drink
and if he be to delight the crowd with song and the manifold sound of music
and exhibit himself dispense generosity or exhibit himself keep the vow of ethical discipline
cultivate tolerance undertake perseverance be absorb in meditative concentration or cultivate wisdom and
even if through these image he be to exhibit himself reborn among the royal class stand out like a tall sāl tree
and similarly exhibit himself reborn among the priestly class stand out like a tall sāl tree
or reborn among the householder class stand out like a tall sāl tree
or similarly exhibit himself reborn among the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm
or similarly exhibit himself reborn among the god of the trayas­triṃśa realm the yāma realm the tuṣita realm the nirmāṇa­rata realm or para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm
and similarly if he be to exhibit himself reborn in the brahmā world
exhibit himself approach the sense field of infinite space or
exhibit himself approach the other sense field up to and include the sense field of neither perception nor non perception or else
if he be similarly to exhibit himself enter the stream or be tie to one more rebirth or no long be subject to rebirth or as an arhat or pratyekabuddha or
if he be to exhibit himself as a great-bodhisattva-being as one who have first begin to set the mind on enlightenment
and then as one who have practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and similarly as one who engage with the first bodhisattva level and
who engage with the other bodhisattva level up to and include the tenth level
and similarly as one who actualize the extrasensory power and
display those extrasensory power illuminate the world system
bring sentient being to maturity and refine the buddhafield and
and even exhibit himself display the meditative concentration the meditative stability and the meditative absorption
or similarly exhibit himself attain the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment and great loving kindness or possess great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha or exhibit himself with his body excellently adorn with the thirty two major mark of a superior man and his body radiant with the eighty minor mark
in all such case those man woman boy and girl who have the disposition of ordinary people would think
o how well train be this man who exhibit himself in various form up to and include the form of the tathāgata
delight these folk with a diversity of form that be attractive to behold and pleasant
what beauty he create
then there might be some man woman boy or girl with the disposition of the wise who be knowledgeable and endow with ideation and scrutiny who would think
since this illusory act be non apprehensible
this man delight these folk with phenomenon which be non existent delude the eye and the mental faculty and
that these sentient being with a childish disposition perceive that which do not exist as a sentient being and
can perceive that which be insubstantial as something substantial
perceive that which be insubstantial as something substantial
it be a wonderful and marvelous phenomenon
in the same way su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not apprehend anything that be apprehensible apart from the expanse of reality and
they do not perceive anything at all apart from the expanse of reality
yet although they apprehend no sentient being or anything that be designate as a sentient being
owe to their skill in mean they themselves dispense generosity and
they encourage other to acquire generosity
similarly they encourage other to cultivate ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom
they speak in praise of wisdom and so forth and
they rejoice in and speak in praise of other who cultivate generosity ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
owe to their skill in mean
will not be discourage from benefit themselves and from benefit other
the same refrain should be apply to all phenomenon as it have be indicate here in the context of the transcendent-perfection
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if all phenomenon be empty of inherent existence
and if in the emptiness of inherent existence no sentient being or anything at all be apprehensible
then how do great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
strive toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient being
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti that be right it be just as you have say
su­bhūti if all thing be not empty of inherent existence
great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
would not demonstrate to sentient being that all thing be empty of inherent existence
so su­bhūti it be because all thing be empty of inherent existence
that great-bodhisattva-being abide in the emptiness of inherent existence
demonstrate to sentient being that all thing be empty of inherent existence
no venerable lord he respond
the blessed one then say su­bhūti in the same manner great-bodhisattva-being having emanate the array of a universal monarch proceed to offer food to those in need of nourishment
and in the same vein they grant the other aforementioned gift up to and include the appropriate human resource but they have not actually dispense any gift to any sentient being
if you ask why
it be because commence from the reality of illusion such be the reality of all thing
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
they will be reborn in the family of a universal monarch since they be able to take birth at will
dwell as mighty lord in the family of a universal monarch they will establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number on the path of the ten virtuous action
likewise they will establish they in the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption
the same go for the four application of mindfulness and so on up to and include the noble eightfold path and the three gateway to liberation
they will also establish they in the fruitional attribute from the ten power of the tathāgata up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
those sentient being too will never be separate from the teaching of the sacred doctrine until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist have conjure up a large gathering of people and establish they on the path of the ten virtuous action and so on until he have establish they in the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
if su­bhūti you ask what be all the phenomenon with respect to which the emptiness of inherent existence be applicable they be as follow
physical form be empty of inherent existence
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of inherent existence
therefore great-bodhisattva-being abide in the emptiness of inherent existence
correctly perceive that these five psycho physical aggregate be empty of inherent existence
know this they demonstrate the sacred doctrine accordingly to sentient being
similarly know that the twelve sense field and the eighteen sensory element be empty of inherent existence
they demonstrate the sacred doctrine accordingly to sentient being
similarly know that the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration and the four formless absorption be empty of inherent existence
similarly know that the four application of mindfulness and all other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and the three gateway to liberation be empty of inherent existence
similarly know that the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative absorption the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha the thirty two major mark of a superior man and the eighty minor mark be all empty of inherent existence
similarly know that the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment in which all involuntary reincarnation through propensity and all afflict mental state have be abandon be empty of inherent existence
su­bhūti if the emptiness of internal phenomenon be an entity
similarly if the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon
the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality
the emptiness of condition phenomenon the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon
the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence
the emptiness of all thing and the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic be all entity
great-bodhisattva-being would not demonstrate to sentient being the sacred doctrine that all thing be empty of inherent existence
and the emptiness of inherent existence would indeed disintegrate
however the emptiness of inherent existence will neither disintegrate nor will it endure and nor will it go away
if you ask why
it be because it do not abide in any location it do not abide in any direction it do not arise from anywhere and it do not go anywhere
it be the abide nature of all thing
in it there be nothing at all that accrue or disintegrate nothing that be enhance or diminish
nothing that arise or cease and nothing that be afflict or purify
it be the natural expression of all thing
abide in that natural expression great-bodhisattva-being strive toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and yet they do not see anything at all in which they would engage
rather they see that all thing be not to be engage in and be non abide
this be the abide nature of all thing
therefore great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
see that all thing be empty of inherent existence and
they do not turn back from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
it be because in the emptiness of inherent existence self sentient being living creature life individual humankind human being actor agent experiencer experience subject knower and viewer be all non apprehensible
similarly physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non apprehensible
and in the same vein all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark be non apprehensible abide in the emptiness of inherent existence with regard to which this same refrain extensively apply
they do not see anything at all that be obscure and they see that all thing be without obscuration
if for example a fully ordain monk nun layman or laywoman emanate by the tathāgata be to teach the sacred doctrine continuously for an eon or for more than an eon to phantom person also emanate by the tathāgata
do you think su­bhūti
that those phantom person emanate by the tathāgata
would have the good fortune to attain the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth or arhatship
no venerable lord if one be to ask why it be because they be not entity
the blessed one reply su­bhūti it be so it be so
how could non entity attain these fruit
su­bhūti since all thing be non entity
which discern person would be fixate on the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
on the contrary
they would propel live creature who have fall into erroneous view toward non erroneous view and establish they therein
since they be without false imagination they be without erroneous view
where there be no erroneous view there be no self
and there be no sentient being and no other posit subject up to and include knower and viewer
and there be no physical form no feeling no perception no formative predisposition and no consciousness
where there be no physical form no feeling no perception no formative predisposition and no consciousness
there be no self and so on
there be also no causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark
this be the emptiness of inherent existence
abide therein great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
liberate sentient being from erroneous view
that be to say they liberate those sentient being who perceive that non sentient being be sentient and
similarly who perceive that they be permanent
who perceive that they be imbue with happiness who perceive that they be a self
who perceive that they be attractive
and similarly who perceive that there be physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness from all these notion up to and include the notion that there be consciousness
this refrain should also be apply in the same vein to all phenomenon up to and include thing that be contaminate and thing that be uncontaminated
as for the thing which be uncontaminated comprise the four application of mindfulness
the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty
the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path
the three gateway to liberation and
in the same vein the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they too be not existent in the manner of an unconditioned phenomenon view from the standpoint of ultimate reality
for these phenomenon be uncreate
they be non entity they be the emptiness of inherent existence
this be the enlightenment of the lord buddhas wherein there be no self
no sentient being and no other posited subject up to and include knower and viewer
there be no physical form no feeling no perception no formative predisposition and no consciousness
and in the same vein there be no causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark
great-bodhisattva-being do not deliberately follow the path that lead to perfect enlightenment for the sake of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment except for the sake of the emptiness of inherent existence
this emptiness of inherent existence be the emptiness of inherent existence with respect to the limit of past time the limit of future time and the limit of the present time in between
great-bodhisattva-being abide in this emptiness of inherent existence
practice the understanding of the aspect of the path in order to liberate from all notion those sentient being who have the notion that they be sentient being
when they practice the understanding of the aspect of the path
they practice the path of the śrāvaka the path of the pratyekabuddha the path of genuinely perfect enlightenment and all other path
they practice the path of the śrāvaka the path of the pratyekabuddha the path of genuinely perfect enlightenment and all other path
when they have perfect those path bring sentient being to maturity
refine the buddhafield and be bless with the formative predisposition conductive to longevity
they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the way of the buddha will not be interrupt
if you ask what be the way of the buddha it be this very emptiness of inherent existence
and it will also be the way of the sacred teaching of the lord buddhas who will appear in the future
the way of the sacred teaching of the lord buddhas who appear in the past be indeed this emptiness of inherent existence
the way of the sacred teaching of the lord buddhas who reside and be present in the innumerable world system of the ten direction at the present time
be also this same emptiness of inherent existence
apart from the emptiness of inherent existence there be no lord buddha who will appear in the world
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being should practice the six transcendent-perfection which be the emptiness of inherent existence
this be the conduct conducive to enlightenment
great-bodhisattva-being who practice it will not regress from omniscience
o venerable lord it be wonderful that great-bodhisattva-being have practice the emptiness of inherent existence with respect to all thing and
physical form be one thing feeling be another perception be another formative predisposition be another consciousness another and the emptiness of inherent existence yet another
and in the same vein that all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be distinct thing
and that even unsurpasse genuinely perfect enlightenment be distinct and the emptiness of inherent existence be something else
yet do not disrupt
rather the emptiness of inherent existence be unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and
unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be itself the emptiness of inherent existence
the blessed one then reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly will refine all the attribute power and assurance of the buddha they will not fall into the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
thereupon senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord inasmuch as all thing be naturally pure what be the attribute of great-bodhisattva-being that should be refine
the blessed one reply it be so su­bhūti it be just as you have say
su­bhūti all thing be naturally pure
su­bhūti inasmuch as all thing be naturally pure when these great-bodhisattva-being train in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom it be their absence of fear and intimidation with respect to all thing that constitute the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
but since ordinary people do not know this for the sake of ordinary people great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the same vein they practice the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train accordingly obtain the power and assurance of the buddha with respect to all thing and they will not regress to the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha they will transcend the mental activity conceptual elaboration and distraction of all sentient being
for example su­bhūti just as there be few place on earth where gold or silver be find in the same way su­bhūti those who have undertake this training and practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be few in number on the other hand those sentient being who undertake training with the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha as their objective be much more numerous
kauśika the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not attain even the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whether in the sense of a designation in the sense of an intimation or in the sense of a formulation
venerable lord how then do it bring about attainment
the blessed one reply
it bring about attainment insofar as it do not admit not establish not abandon not adhere to and not attain anything at all
kauśika so it be that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom bring about the attainment of all thing without attain anything at all
then śakra mighty lord of the god say to the blessed one
venerable lord how wonderful that this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be establish because all thing neither arise nor do they cease and they be unconditione unapprehended and without fixation
thereupon senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being wonder whether the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom bring about the attainment of all thing
but perceive to the contrary that it do not bring about attainment
in that case venerable lord those bodhisattva would undervalue the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and keep far away from it
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti there be a distinct way in which bodhisattva might undervalue the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and keep far away from it
if su­bhūti when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they be to perceive
alas the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be flaccid insignificant and pointless
alas the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be vacuous
in that case they would undervalue the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and keep far away from it
su­bhūti that be the distinct way in which bodhisattva might undervalue the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and keep far away from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if one trust in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom what be the thing in which one should not trust
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti if you have conviction in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom you should not have conviction in physical form
similarly you should not have conviction in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
you should not have conviction in the eye and you should not have conviction in the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty
you should not have conviction in the sense field of sight and you should not have conviction in the other sense object up to and include mental phenomenon
similarly you should not have conviction in the transcendent-perfection of generosity and you should not have conviction in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
you should not have conviction in the emptiness of internal phenomenon and you should not have conviction in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
you should not have conviction in the application of mindfulness and you should not have conviction in the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
similarly you should not have conviction in the ten power of the tathāgata and you should not have conviction in the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
you should not have conviction in the fruit of enter the stream
similarly you should not have conviction in the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth to the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth and to the fruit of arhatship
you should not have conviction in individual enlightenment
su­bhūti if physical form be one thing and the emptiness of inherent existence another
and similarly if feeling be one thing perception another thing
and similarly if feeling be one thing perception another thing
formative predisposition another thing consciousness another thing and the emptiness of inherent existence yet another
and if all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include enlightenment be distinct thing and the emptiness of inherent existence something else
then great-bodhisattva-being would indeed not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in omniscience
su­bhūti it be because the emptiness of inherent existence be physical form
and similarly feeling perception and formative predisposition
and because the emptiness of inherent existence be consciousness and the emptiness of inherent existence be all the attribute and attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
know all thing to be empty of inherent existence and then
attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
in this emptiness of inherent existence there be nothing at all that disintegrate endure or depart
those ordinary people with diverse notion think that physical form be one distinct thing and the emptiness of inherent existence another
and similarly they think that the other aggregate up to and include consciousness be distinct thing and the emptiness of inherent existence another
and in the same vein
they think that all the attribute and attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be distinct thing and the emptiness of inherent existence another
by think accordingly they become fixate on physical form
similarly they become fixate on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and so they indulge in notion of i and mine and also become fixate upon they
having become fixate they will at the time of their rebirth generate physical form
and similarly they will generate feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they will not be liberate from rebirth aging ill health death sorrow lamentation suffering discomfort and agitation
they will not be release from the cycle of cyclic existence with its five class of live being
so it be that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not hold that physical form be either empty or not empty and they neither grasp nor disrupt they
similarly they do not hold that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be either empty or not empty
and they neither grasp nor disrupt they
in the same vein
they do not hold that all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include enlightenment be either empty or not empty
if you ask why
emptiness be physical form it be the other aggregate up to and include consciousness
it be all the attribute and attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
it be because they do not disrupt physical form and they do not disrupt feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness claim that
for example su­bhūti just as space do not disrupt space
the internal space element do not at all disrupt the external space element
and the external space element do not at all disrupt the internal space element
in the same way su­bhūti
physical form do not disrupt emptiness nor do emptiness disrupt physical form
similarly the other aggregate up to and include consciousness do not disrupt emptiness
nor do emptiness disrupt the other aggregate up to and include consciousness
in the same vein
all the attribute and attainment up to and include enlightenment do not disrupt emptiness
nor do emptiness disrupt all the attribute and attainment up to and include enlightenment
if you ask why
it be because all thing be without an essential nature concern which one might be mislead into thinking this be empty this be not empty
this complete the thirtieth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle inherent existence
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
attract sentient being with the gift of the sacred doctrine
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti there be two way in which great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom attract sentient being with the gift of the sacred doctrine
su­bhūti these comprise the mundane and supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine
if you ask what constitute the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine
that which describe explain demonstrate and analyze mundane phenomenon
describe explain demonstrating and analyze the early chapter on repulsive phenomenon along with the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption and the five extrasensory power
be designate as the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine
if you ask why this be mundane
it be call mundane because it do not transcend the world
having dispense that mundane gift
for many reason they then dissuade and turn sentient being away from those meditative concentration immeasurable aspiration formless absorption and extrasensory power
then after dissuade and turn they away
they also establish they through skill in mean in the sublime attribute
that be to say they establish sentient being in the four application of mindfulness and similarly in the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and the three gateway to liberation
similarly they establish they in the fruit of enter the stream and in the other fruit up to an include individual enlightenment
this be call the supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine
if you ask why it be supramundane
it be because it transcend the world and be exalt over the world system
if with regard to the sublime attribute you ask what be the fruit of the sublime attribute
the term sublime attribute denote the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
the three gateway to liberation the ten power of the tathāgata and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
the fruit of those sublime attribute comprise the fruit of enter the stream
and in the same vein
all other fruit up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
at the very least su­bhūti
the sublime attribute of great-bodhisattva-being
include the knowledge of the fruit of enter the stream knowledge of the other fruit up to and include knowledge of the fruit of individual enlightenment and
similarly knowledge of the causal attribute up to and include the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment and
similarly knowledge of the ten power of the tathāgata
and knowledge of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly they include knowledge of contaminated and uncontaminated phenomenon
of mundane and supramundane phenomenon and of condition and unconditioned phenomenon
these be call the sublime attribute of great-bodhisattva-being
then if you ask what constitute the fruit of the sublime attribute of great-bodhisattva-being
these include the renunciation of all afflict mental state and of all propensity and impulse toward involuntary reincarnation
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord will great-bodhisattva-being also attain omniscience
the blessed one reply su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have say
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being will also attain omniscience
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being will also attain omniscience
what then be the distinction between great-bodhisattva-being and the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
how be these to be differentiate
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being will attain omniscience and
start from the moment they attain omniscience they will be call tathāgata
su­bhūti the tathāgata have absolutely reach the culmination of all thing
and the bodhisattva follow in their wake
the tathāgata have attain non stupidity with respect to all thing
and the bodhisattvas will subsequently attain that state
this su­bhūti be the distinction between the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and great-bodhisattva-being
this be how they be to be differentiate
su­bhūti the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow
be designate as the support for the supramundane doctrine
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
through their skill in mean introduce sentient being to the mundane gift of the sacred doctrine
and then introduce and establish they in the supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine which be the abode of the sublime one
similarly they establish they in all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience
moreover su­bhūti if you ask what constitute the supramundane doctrine of great-bodhisattva-being that be not share in common with ordinary people
the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability
the five faculty the five power the seven aspect of enlightenment
the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation
the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative equipoise the ten power of the tathāgata
the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion
and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
the thirty two major mark and eighty minor mark of a superior man
all the gateway of mnemonic incantation and all the gateway of meditative stability
these constitute the supramundane doctrine of great-bodhisattva-being
and the describing explain demonstrating and analyze of these supramundane attribute be call the supramundane gift of the sacred doctrine
in this regard if you ask what constitute the four application of mindfulness
great-bodhisattva-being who be diligent alert and mindful
having eliminate covetousness and sadness with regard to the inner physical body continue to observe the physical body
this same refrain should be extensively apply also to the outer physical body and similarly to inner and outer feeling as well as to mind and phenomenon
these four which concern body feeling mind and phenomenon be call the four application of mindfulness
if you ask what constitute the four correct exertion
great-bodhisattva-being resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that negative and non virtuous attribute which have not yet arise might not be develop
they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that negative and non virtuous attribute which have previously arise might be renounce
they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attribute which have not yet arisen might be develop
they resolve struggle strive persevere with tenacity and rightly aspire that virtuous attribute which have previously arise might remain might not degenerate and might flourish further increase and reach complete perfection
these be call the four correct exertion
if you ask what constitute the four support for miraculous ability
su­bhūti   great-bodhisattva-being imbue with renunciation who dwell in solitude maintain detachment and remain in a state of cessation should cultivate the support for miraculous ability combine the meditative stability of resolution with the formative force of exertion
similarly imbue with renunciation dwell in solitude maintain detachment and remain in a state of cessation they should cultivate the support for miraculous ability combine the meditative stability of perseverance the meditative stability of mind and the meditative stability of scrutiny with the formative force of exertion
these four resolution perseverance mind and scrutiny be call the four support for miraculous ability
if you ask what constitute the five faculty
they comprise
the faculty of faith   the faculty of perseverance   the faculty of recollection   the faculty of meditative stability and   the faculty of wisdom
these be call the five faculty
if you ask what constitute the five power
the power of faith   the power of perseverance   the power of recollection   the power of meditative stability and   the power of wisdom
these be call the five power
if you ask what constitute the seven branch of enlightenment
the branch of enlightenment that entail correct recollection
and the branch of enlightenment that entail correct   doctrinal analysis
perseverance   delight   mental and physical refinement   meditative stability and   equanimity
these be call the seven branch of enlightenment
if you ask what constitute the noble eightfold path it comprise
correct view   correct ideation   correct speech   correct action   correct livelihood   correct effort   correct recollection and   correct meditative stability
these constitute the noble eightfold path
if you ask what constitute the three gateway to liberation
emptiness as a gateway to liberation   signlessness as a gateway to liberation and   aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation
these be call the three gateway to liberation
among they if you ask what constitute emptiness as a gateway to liberation
one pointedness of mind base on the aspect of emptiness
be call emptiness as a gateway to liberation
if you ask what constitute signlessness as a gateway to liberation
one pointedness of mind base on the aspect of signlessness
be call signlessness as a gateway to liberation
if you ask what constitute aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation
one pointedness of mind base on the aspect of impermanence and the aspect of suffer
be call aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation
if you ask what constitute the eight aspect of liberation
they be as follow
the first aspect of liberation ensue when corporeal being observe physical form
the second aspect of liberation ensue when formless being endow with internal perception observe external physical form
the third aspect of liberation ensue when being physically actualize achieve and maintain release from their inclination toward pleasant state
the fourth aspect of liberation ensue when the perception of physical form have be transcend in all respect
when the perception of obstruct phenomenon have subside and
when the mind do not engage with diverse perception so that one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite space think space be infinite
the fifth sixth and seventh aspect of liberation ensue when one achieve and abide in the other sense field up to and include the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
the eighth aspect of liberation ensue when the sense field of neither perception nor non perception have be completely transcend in all respect
and one physically actualize achieve and abide in the cessation of all perception and feeling
these be call the eight aspect of liberation
if you ask what constitute the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
the first ensue when one achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration
that be to say when there be freedom from desire and freedom from negative and non virtuous attribute
while ideation and scrutiny be present alongside the joy and bliss that arise from that freedom
similarly the second third and fourth ensue when one achieve and maintain the second third and fourth meditative concentration
similarly the remain step ensue when one achieve and abide in the formless absorption from the sense field of infinite space to the cessation of all perception and feeling
these be call the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
if you ask what constitute the ten power of the tathāgata
you should not have conviction in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
you should not have conviction in the understanding of all phenomenon
you should not have conviction in the understanding of the aspect of the path
you should not have conviction in omniscience
on the other hand su­bhūti you should have conviction in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom because physical form be non apprehensible
similarly you should have conviction in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non apprehensible
in the same vein you should have conviction in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom because all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be non apprehensible
su­bhūti those who have conviction in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without apprehend anything have conviction in physical form
similarly they have conviction in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein if they have conviction without apprehend anything in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they will have conviction in all those other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
senior su­bhūti then say to the blessed one
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the great transcendent-perfection
the blessed one ask
su­bhūti for what reason do you think this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the great transcendent-perfection
he reply
it do not enhance physical form nor do it diminish they
similarly it do not enhance feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness nor do it diminish they
it do not enhance the transcendent-perfection of generosity nor do it diminish it
similarly it do not enhance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration nor do it diminish they
similarly it do not enhance the emptiness of internal phenomenon nor do it diminish it
similarly it do not enhance the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity nor do it diminish they
similarly it do not enhance the application of mindfulness nor do it diminish they
similarly it do not enhance the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path nor do it diminish they
it do not enhance the ten power of the tathāgata nor do it diminish they
similarly it do not enhance the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha nor do it diminish they
it do not enhance enlightenment nor do it diminish it
it do not enhance buddhahood nor do it diminish it
moreover the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not absorb physical form nor do it diffuse they
similarly it do not absorb feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness nor do it diffuse they
in the same vein it do not absorb all those other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include buddhahood nor do it diffuse they
moreover the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not measure physical form nor do it not measure they
in the same vein it do not measure all those other attribute up to and include buddhahood nor do it not measure they
moreover the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not enlarge physical form nor do it contract they
similarly it do not enlarge feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness nor do it contract they
in the same vein it do not enlarge all those other attribute up to and include buddhahood nor do it contract they
moreover the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not strengthen physical form nor do it weaken they
similarly it do not strengthen feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness nor do it weaken they
in the same vein it do not strengthen all those other attribute up to and include buddhahood nor do it weaken they
venerable lord for these reason this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the great transcendent-perfection possess by great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti they be as follow
the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha definitively know that thing which be possible be indeed possible
and that thing which be impossible be indeed impossible
moreover the tathāgata definitively know through contingency and cause the maturation of the past future and present action of sentient being and of those who undertake such action
in addition the tathāgata definitively know multiple world system and diverse sensory element
moreover the tathāgata definitively know whether the acuman of other sentient being and other individual be supreme or not
also the tathāgata definitively know the world endow with a diversity of inclination and a multiplicity of inclination
moreover the tathāgata definitively know the path that lead everywhere
moreover the tathāgata definitively know all the afflict and purify mental state and their emergence associate with the meditative concentration aspect of liberation meditative stability and formless absorption
moreover with pure divine clairvoyance surpass the sight of human being the tathāgata definitively perceive and definitively know all the circumstance of sentient being from their death and rebirth to how they proceed to blissful realm how they proceed to inferior realm and how they proceed in accordance with their past action
in addition the tathāgata recollect many former abode
that be to say having recollect a single past life
they can recollect many former abode
along with their circumstance and their locale
moreover the tathāgata definitively know that through their extrasensory power they have actualize achieve and maintain in this very lifetime the liberation of mind and the liberation of wisdom in the state that be free from contaminant because all contaminant have cease
my rebirth have come to an end i have practice chastity
i have fulfil my duty i will not experience other rebirth apart from this one
these be call the ten power of the tathāgata
i have fulfil my duty i will not experience other rebirth apart from this one
and so they may say
if you ask what constitute the four assurance claim by the buddha they be as follow
when i claim to have attain genuinely perfect buddhahood
if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else should say that i have not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to these particular phenomenon here i would correctly disregard that reason for contradict i base on their worldly doctrine
by correctly disregard that reason i have find happiness and abide therein
by correctly disregard that reason i have find happiness and abide therein
to have attain this absence of trepidation be to have attain fearlessness
i claim my exalt place as a great leader
i will rightly roar the lion ’s roar in the midst of the assembly
i will turn the wheel of brahmā which have not previously be turn in the world in conformity with the sacred doctrine by any virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else
when i claim i be one whose contaminant have cease
if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else should say that these particular contaminant of mine have not cease i would correctly disregard that reason for contradict i and so on in the same vein as before
when i claim to have explain those thing which cause obstacle on the spiritual path if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else should say in this respect that even though one might depend on those thing there will be no obstacle
i would correctly disregard that reason for contradict i and so on in the same vein as before
when i claim to have explain the path through which suffering will genuinely cease having ascertain that śrāvaka will find it conducive to the attainment of sublime emancipation if some virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else in the world should say in this respect that this path will not be conducive to emancipation that there will be no definitive realization and that the suffering of those who enact it will not cease
i would correctly disregard that reason for contradict i and so on in the same vein as before
these be call the four assurance of the tathāgata
if you ask what constitute the four unhindered discernment they comprise
unhindered discernment of meaning   unhindered discernment of the doctrine   unhindered discernment of etymological definition and   unhindered discernment of inspiration
these be call the four unhindered discernment
if you ask what constitute great loving kindness
it be an action in which the tathāgata engage on behalf of all sentient being
treat enemy and friend identically
that be call great loving kindness
if you ask what constitute great compassion
it be unstinting love kindness even toward sentient being when there be actually no sentient being
that be call great compassion
if you ask what constitute the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha they be as follow
the tathāgata be without clumsiness   they be not noisy   they be without false memory
they be without unabsorbed mind   they be without differentiate perception
they be without indifference that do not make distinction   they do not degenerate in their resolution
they do not degenerate in their perseverance   they do not degenerate in their recollection
they do not degenerate in their meditative stability   they do not degenerate in their wisdom
they do not degenerate in their liberation nor in their perception of liberate pristine cognition
they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which be unobstructed and unimpede with respect to the past
they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which be unobstructed and unimpede with respect to the future
they engage in the perception of pristine cognition which be unobstructed and unimpede with respect to the present
all the activity of their body be precede by pristine cognition and follow by pristine cognition
all the activity of their speech be precede by pristine cognition and follow by pristine cognition and
all the activity of their mind be precede by pristine cognition and follow by pristine cognition
these be call the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
if you ask what be the thirty two major mark of a superior man that the tathāgata possess they be as follow
the blessed one have foot that be well positioned
in this regard excellent positioning of the foot mean that the sol of his two foot entirely touch the ground
just as when the long evenly balanced leg of a jar be place on level ground
the whole of the base entirely touch the ground
in the same way the blessed one be endow with foot that be well positioned
the blessed one have foot that be mark with the motif of the wheel
in this regard the expression mark with the motif of the wheel denote the motif of a wheel with a thousand spoke a hub and a circumference which appear on the sol of his two foot entirely golden in color
the blessed one have palm and sol that be tender and soft
in this regard the tenderness and softness of his palm and sol mean that they resemble the smooth surface of a kapok sheet or a cotton sheet
unlike those of other human being
the blessed one have long toe and finger
in this regard long toe and finger mean that the finger of his hand and the toe of his foot be exceedingly long
the blessed one be endow with hand and foot that be web
similarly contingent on the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and
the transcendent-perfection of generosity
venerable lord if great-bodhisattva-being who have newly enter the great vehicle
that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom enhance or diminish physical form
and similarly that it enhance or diminishe feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and in the same vein that it enhance or diminishe all those other attribute up to and include buddhahood
and in the same vein that it absorb or diffuse measure or do not measure enlarge or contract and strengthen or weaken physical form
contingent on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
perceive
and similarly that it strengthen or weaken feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being do not practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
it be because anything that enhance or diminish physical form
and in the same vein anything that enhance or diminishe all those other attribute up to and include buddhahood can not be an outcome of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
anything that strengthen or weaken physical form
and similarly anything that strengthen or weaken feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
and in the same vein anything that strengthen or weaken all those other attribute up to and include buddhahood can not be an outcome of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
anything that enhance or diminish physical form
senior su­bhūti if the meditative stability and the bodhisattva be not distinct from one another and if the meditative stability be themselves the bodhisattvas and the bodhisattva be themselves the meditative stability and if both the meditative stability and the bodhisattva be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then they will not know through their meditative stability that all thing be sameness nor will they have any cognition
senior śāradvatī­putra for these reason great-bodhisattva-being do not know through their meditative stability that all thing be sameness nor do they have any cognition
if you ask why he continue
it be owe to the non existence of that bodhisattva that meditative stability and that transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that they do not know and indeed that they have no cognition
then the venerable lord congratulate senior su­bhūti
well say su­bhūti well say
you whom i have declare to be supreme among śrāvakas abide free from afflict mental state you have speak these word well in conformity with your approach
great-bodhisattva-being should indeed train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
they should train accordingly in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly they should train in the application of mindfulness and in the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and in the ten power of the tathāgata and in the same vein in the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly do they train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the venerable lord reply
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly they do train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in do so they train without apprehend anything
it be in the same manner that they train in the other transcendent-perfection from the transcendent-perfection of generosity onwards
in the same vein when they train accordingly they also train in the causal attribute from the application of mindfulness onwards and
when they train accordingly they also train in the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
in do so they train without apprehend anything
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the venerable lord
venerable lord so be it the case that when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly they train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and in do so that they train without apprehend anything
the venerable lord reply
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly they do indeed train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without apprehend anything
then he ask
venerable lord what be it that they do not apprehend
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend a self they do not apprehend sentient being and so on they do not apprehend knower and viewer
similarly owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend the psycho physical aggregate
they do not apprehend the sensory element
they do not apprehend the sense field
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend fundamental ignorance and they do not apprehend the other link of dependent origination up to and include aging and death
similarly owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend the truth of suffer
nor do they apprehend the truth of the origin of suffering the cessation of suffering and the path that lead to it
similarly owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend the world system of desire
similarly owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend the application of mindfulness and they do not apprehend the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
nor do they apprehend the world system of form and nor do they apprehend the world system of formlessness
similarly owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend the ten power of the tathāgata and they do not apprehend the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend the six transcendent-perfection
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend those enter the stream
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend those who be tie to one more rebirth those who will not be reborn and those who have attain arhatship
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend pratyekabuddhas
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend bodhisattvas
owe to the utter purity of all thing they do not apprehend tathāgata
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the venerable lord
venerable lord what be that purity
the blessed one reply
purity indicate that all thing be non arising similarly they be uncease they be neither afflict nor be they purify they do not arise and they be without apprehension all thing be unconditioned
venerable lord when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly in what thing do they train
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being train accordingly they do not train in anything at all
if you ask why
śāradvatī­putra it be because these thing be non existent in the way that ordinary people be fixate on they
venerable lord how be it that these thing be non existent in the way that ordinary people be fixate on they
they exist to the extent that they do not exist and accordingly since they do not exist their posited existence be call fundamental ignorance
venerable lord he ask why be these thing that do not exist call fundamental ignorance
śāradvatī­putra it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that physical form be non existent
similarly it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non existent
similarly it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that the application of mindfulness be non existent and non apprehensible
in the same vein it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be non existent however
through their adherence to the two extreme of eternalism and nihilism
without know and without see
they imagine those thing that be non existent
and after impute they they become fixate on the psycho physical aggregate that constitute name and form
in the same vein
it be owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity that the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be non existent however
ordinary people through their fixation due to fundamental ignorance and craving become fixated and impute that which be non existent as existent
they become fixate on all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
since owe to their fixation on these thing they imagine thing that be non existent they do not know and they do not see
if you ask what they do not know and do not see
they neither know nor see physical form
similarly they neither know nor see feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they neither know nor see the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
it be precisely because they neither know nor see that they come to be style ordinary people
these people will not attain emancipation and
if you ask what it be that they will not be emancipate from
they will not be emancipate from the world system of desire
similarly they will not be emancipate from the world system of form or the world system of formlessness
they will not be emancipate into the doctrine of the śrāvaka or the pratyekabuddha
they will not be emancipate into the doctrine of the bodhisattvas
they will not be emancipate into the doctrine of the genuinely perfect buddha
they lack conviction
they lack the conviction that physical form be emptiness
similarly they lack the conviction that feeling be emptiness that perception be emptiness that formative predisposition be emptiness that consciousness be emptiness and so on up to and include the fruitional attribute
also they be not stable
if you ask what it be in which they be not stable
they be not stable in the transcendent-perfection of generosity they be not stable in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they be not stable in the irreversible sublime level and they be not stable in the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
for that reason they be call ordinary people
and they be say to be fixate
if you ask what be their fixation and on what they be fixate
they be fixate on physical form and they be fixate on the other aggregate include consciousness
similarly they be fixate on the eye and in the same manner they be fixate on the other sense organ include the mental faculty
they be fixate on sight sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
similarly they be fixate on the sensory element
they be fixate on desire hatred and delusion
they be fixate on opinion
they be fixate on the application of mindfulness and in the same vein they be fixate on the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the venerable lord
venerable lord when bodhisattvas train accordingly be it then the case that they do not train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
that they will not attain emancipation in omniscience
the blessed one reply
śāradvatī­putra the bodhisattvas who train accordingly do not train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they will not attain emancipation in omniscience
do you think su­bhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have establish any sentient being on the path of the ten virtuous action
and in the same vein do you think he would have establish anyone in those other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
no venerable lord
the blessed one then say
su­bhūti in the same manner great-bodhisattva-being establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number on the path of the ten virtuous action
and in the same vein establish they in the other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha but they have not actually establish any sentient being at all
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because commence with the reality of illusion this be in fact the reality of all thing su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance they will establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number in tolerance
su­bhūti if one be to ask in what way great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in tolerance
in this regard su­bhūti from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being don their armor
if all sentient being be to approach i and even strike i with stick weapon or clod of earth
i would not generate any thought of anger toward any sentient being
and i would indeed establish all sentient being in such patient endurance
having don their armor even if they be afflict on be strike by the clod of earth stick or weapon hurl by enemy and assailant
they would never generate a thought of anger toward any sentient being but instead they would establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in such patient endurance
su­bhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist have conjure up a large gathering of people and establish they in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance do you think
su­bhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have establish any sentient being in tolerance
no venerable lord
the blessed one then say
su­bhūti in the same manner great-bodhisattva-being establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number in tolerance but they have not actually establish any sentient being at all
su­bhūti it be because commence with the reality of illusion this be in fact the reality of all thing
su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
they will encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
their mind endow with omniscience they will encourage secure and establish those sentient being in physical and mental perseverance in order that they might abandon non virtuous doctrine and undertake the excellent virtuous doctrine
su­bhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist have conjure up a large gathering of people and then encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
do you think su­bhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have establish any sentient being in perseverance
su­bhūti in the same manner great-bodhisattva-being establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance but they have not actually establish any sentient being at all
su­bhūti it be because commence with the reality of illusion this be in fact the reality of all thing
su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration they will encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
su­bhūti if one be to ask in what way great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
in this regard su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being abide in the meditative stability of sameness with regard to all thing and they do not consider whether anything be in equipoise or distracted
in that manner exclusively they encourage secure and establish sentient being in meditative concentration and in various way they encourage secure and establish they so that they will never be separate from the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist have conjure up a large gathering of people
for example su­bhūti just as there be few who have undertake action fit for a universal monarch while those who have undertake action fit for a garrison commander be much more numerous in the same way su­bhūti those sentient being who have enter upon the path that lead to omniscience be few in number whereas those sentient being who have enter upon the path of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha be much more numerous
also su­bhūti among those person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas those who be inclined toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and who will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood be few in number whereas those person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas but regress to the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha be much more numerous
su­bhūti those person who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas and who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without hesitation will enter into the irreversible level
those who do not practice it without hesitation will not irreversibly attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who wish to enter into the irreversible level should train in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will never develop thought of miserliness
they will never develop thought of degenerate morality thought of indolence thought of distraction and thought of stupidity
they will never develop thought of desire thought of hatred and thought of delusion

by practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
so it be su­bhūti that when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they attract sentient being with their two gift the worldly gift and the gift of the sacred doctrine
this su­bhūti be indeed the wonderful and marvelous doctrine of great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the six transcendent-perfection
how you may ask do they attract sentient being with their pleasant speech
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the six transcendent-perfection
in the beginning they attract sentient being exclusively through the transcendent-perfection of generosity
subsequently they do so through the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
thereafter they do so through the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
thereafter they do so through the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
thereafter they do so through the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
and thereafter they attract sentient being through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti it be by mean of these six transcendent-perfection that great-bodhisattva-being attract sentient being through their pleasant speech
if you ask why
it be because these six transcendent-perfection subsume all virtuous attribute
su­bhūti if you ask how great-bodhisattva-being attract sentient being through their purposeful activity
great-bodhisattva-being always attract sentient being without do anything else
when su­bhūti they practice the six transcendent-perfection over a long period of time
venerable lord how be that so
the blessed one reply
that be to say they attract they through their gift through their pleasant speech
śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who be unskillful conceive of and become fixate on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they conceive of and become fixate on the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity
in the same vein they conceive of and become fixate on the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
through their purposeful activity and through their harmony
su­bhūti if you ask what constitute the eighty minor mark which the tathāgata have they be as follow
the lord buddha be endow with copper color nail
having become fixate they conceive of the understanding of all thing
their body be firm like that of nārāyaṇa   their kneecap be elegant
and of omniscience and it be after imagine these that they become fixate on omniscience
their body be clean   their body be soft   their body be supple   their body be lustrous
their body be not slouch   their finger and toe be compact
śāradvatī­putra for these reason bodhisattva do not train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
the lord buddha have round finger and toe   their finger and toe be taper
they will not attain emancipation in the state of omniscience
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
their blood vessel and nerve be inconspicuous   their ankle be inconspicuous
their body be well form   their body be well proportion   their sense be completely purified
their understanding be perfectly pure   their behavior be excellent
venerable lord so be it the case that when bodhisattvas train accordingly they do not train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
they do not attain emancipation in omniscience
śāradvatī­putra bodhisattva who train accordingly do not train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
they do not attain emancipation in omniscience
their voice be deep   their navel be deep   their navel be well rounded
their navel curl to the right
venerable lord he ask how should great-bodhisattva-being then train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
their lip be red like the balsam fruit   their mouth be compact
how do great-bodhisattva-being on training accordingly attain emancipation in omniscience
their mouth be not too wide   their mouth be without blemish
the lord buddha be endow with splendor and intelligence   they be worthy of behold
their arm and leg be compact
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not consider the nature of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
the lord buddha be endow with well proportion arm and leg as intend
śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner
their palm be even   the line of their palm be unbroken   the line of their palm be extend
their body be immaculate and without unpleasant odor   their complexion be radiant
they train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without apprehend anything and
sense faculties]—the gate to the sense fields’—are excellent   their face be like the full moon
attain emancipation in omniscience
they speak first   their face be without frown of anger
if you ask what be this non apprehension
the pore of their body all emit a pleasant odor   their mouth be fragrant
when they practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity
their gait be that of a lion   their gait be that of a mighty elephant   their gait be that of a swan
hey do not apprehend this transcendent-perfection of generosity
their head be large similar to a parasol   their speech be sweet and fully perfect
they be endow with sharp eye tooth   their nose be prominent   their tongue be red
the lord buddha have a tongue that be slender and large
in the same vein when they practice the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they do not apprehend the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth they do not apprehend the causal attribute up to and include enlightenment
their body hair be bluish black   their body hair be clean   their eye be wide
they do not apprehend the fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience
their orifice be without deterioration   their palm and sol be red
it be owe to their non apprehension that they train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
their navel do not protrude   their abdomen be not misshapen   their abdomen be slender
venerable lord he ask with respect to what will they attain emancipation owe to their non apprehension
the lord buddha have an abdomen light body that be unwrinkled   their joint be elegant
the blessed one reply
their joint be extend   their hand and foot be utterly pure
they will attain emancipation owe to their non apprehension of the emptiness of internal phenomenon and in the same vein owe to their non apprehension of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of all thing
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
they have a symmetrical aureole of light extend a full arm span
venerable lord from what will emancipation be attain by mean of this vehicle and where will this vehicle come to rest
their luminosity radiate as they walk   they satisfy whichever god and human encounter they
su­bhūti emancipation will be attain from the three world system and consequently emancipation will be attain in omniscience
they be never mistreat though visible to all creature
they instruct sentient being
their speech be pervasive in conformity with their assembly but it do not extend outside their assembly
it will come to rest therein and it will do so owe to non duality
if you ask why
it be because the doctrine of the great vehicle and the doctrine which be omniscience be neither conjoin nor disjoin
they share a single define characteristic in that they be immaterial unrevealed unimpeded and without define characteristic
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because thing that be without define characteristic do not attain emancipation will not attain emancipation and have not attain emancipation
it be because one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the expanse of reality
similarly one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the real nature and
merely wish to attain emancipation in the finality of existence
similarly one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the inconceivable expanse

so on up to and include feeling due to sensory contact that be mentally compound
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the emptiness of the eye will not attain emancipation from the three world system and
will not come to rest in omniscience
similarly the emptiness of the other sensory attribute up to and include feeling due to sensory contact that be mentally compound will not attain emancipation from the three world system and
su­bhūti it be because the eye be empty of the eye and in the same vein
the other sensory attribute be empty of feeling due to sensory contact that be visually compound and so forth similarly feeling due to sensory contact that be mentally compound and so forth be empty of feeling due to sensory contact that be mentally compound
su­bhūti in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in dream
similarly one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in magical display mirage echo optical aberration and in phantom emanation of the tathāgata

su­bhūti in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
similarly su­bhūti one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance in the transcendent-perfection of perseverance in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection of generosity will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
similarly su­bhūti the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection of generosity be empty of the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection of generosity and similarly su­bhūti the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be empty of the essential nature of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
su­bhūti in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the emptiness of internal phenomenon
one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of the emptiness of internal phenomenon will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
in the same vein
the essential nature of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
su­bhūti it be because the emptiness of internal phenomenon be empty of the essential nature of internal phenomenon and in the same vein the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be empty of the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity and so forth
in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the application of mindfulness
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of the application of mindfulness will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of the application of mindfulness be empty of the essential nature of the application of mindfulness
similarly one who wish to attain emancipation in thing that be without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
it be because in the same vein the essential nature of these causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
if you ask why
it be because in the same vein the essential nature of these causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path be empty of the essential nature of the noble eightfold path and so forth
this same refrain should also be extensively apply to the fruitional attribute include the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance and the four mode of analytical knowledge and so on up to the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha just as have be indicate in the context of the noble eightfold path
su­bhūti in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to be bear as an arhat whose contaminant have cease
in the same vein
su­bhūti one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to be bear as a pratyekabuddha or as a tathāgata arhat and genuine perfect buddha
it be because the essential nature of a tathāgata and so forth will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of an arhat whose contaminant have cease be empty of the essential nature of an arhat and similarly the essential nature of a pratyekabuddha be empty of the essential nature of a pratyekabuddha and the essential nature of a tathāgata be empty of the essential nature of a tathāgata

similarly su­bhūti one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth in the fruit of not return to cyclic existence in arhatship in individual enlightenment and in omniscience
the same refrain should be extensively apply to all these fruit just as have be indicate in the context of the noble eightfold path
su­bhūti in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in name
similarly su­bhūti one wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in symbol conventional expression and designation
if you ask why
su­bhūti the emptiness of name will not attain emancipation from the three world system and will not come to rest in omniscience
su­bhūti it be because the emptiness of name be empty of the emptiness of name and in the same vein the emptiness of those other term up to and include designation be empty of the emptiness of designate phenomenon and so forth
su­bhūti in the same way one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in that which be non arise
in the same vein
su­bhūti one who wish to attain emancipation in thing without define characteristic merely wish to attain emancipation in that which be unceasing and in signlessness non affliction non purification and non conditioning

su­bhūti it be for these reason that the great vehicle do attain emancipation from the three world system and consequently come to rest in omniscience and it do so in an unwavering manner
this complete the twelfth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle meditative stability
the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti you ask where this vehicle will come to rest
anything that strengthen or weaken and so forth any of those other attribute up to and include buddhahood
in this regard su­bhūti the vehicle will not come to rest anywhere
do so because its mistaken perception be great
if you ask why
it be because resting be non apprehensible and so all thing do not come to rest
if you ask why
on the other hand the vehicle will come to rest by way of its non rest
it be because there be no enlightenment at all for those who have such mistaken perception
su­bhūti just as the expanse of reality neither come to rest nor do it not come to rest
similarly su­bhūti the vehicle do not come to rest
nor do it not come to rest
the same refrain should be extensively apply here just as have be indicate in the context of the previous chapter
su­bhūti just as non arising neither come to rest nor do it not come to rest
similarly this vehicle do not come to rest nor do it not come to rest
in the same vein
just as non cessation non signlessness non affliction non purification and non conditioning neither come to rest nor do they not come to rest
su­bhūti it be because the essential nature of the expanse of reality be empty of the essential nature of the expanse of reality
in the same vein the essential nature of those other unconditioned phenomenon up to and include non conditioning be empty of non conditioning and so forth
su­bhūti for these reason this great vehicle will not come to rest anywhere but nor will it not do so this be owe to its non rest
also su­bhūti you ask who will attain emancipation by mean of this vehicle
in this regard su­bhūti no one will attain emancipation by mean of this vehicle
su­bhūti it be because all those thing associate with this vehicle and with those who would attain emancipation and that in which emancipation be attain be non existent and they be non apprehensible
since all thing be accordingly non existent and non apprehensible
who could attain emancipation by mean of anything
in what could emancipation possibly be attain
if you ask why
similarly other posit subject from sentient being and living creature to knower and viewer be all non apprehensible
similarly the expanse of reality be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
su­bhūti it be because the self and other posit subject up to and include the knower and the viewer be non apprehensible this be the case the self be never apprehensible
the real nature be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
the finality of existence be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
the inconceivable expanse be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
the psycho physical aggregate and sensory element be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
the sensory element and sense field be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly the transcendent-perfection of generosity be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
similarly the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly the emptiness of internal phenomenon be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
and in the same vein the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly the application of mindfulness be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
and in the same vein
the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
those who have enter the stream be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly those who be tie to one more rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth arhat pratyekabuddhas and those who have become tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly the fruit of having enter the stream be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
similarly the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of be no long subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
omniscience be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
similarly non arising non cessation non affliction non purification and non conditioning be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
the limit of the past be non apprehensible owe to its utter purity
similarly the limit of the future and the present be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly motion non motion rest and arise be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
similarly decrease and increase be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
what you may ask be it that be non apprehensible on account of which all thing be not apprehend
thing be not apprehend because the expanse of reality be non apprehensible
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the expanse of reality owe to its utter purity have not be be not and will not be apprehend by anyone

their torso resemble that of a lion
the joint of their body be well articulated   their crown protuberance be inconspicuous
the hair of their head be bluish black soft and long   the hair of their head be not dishevel
the hair of their head point upwards finely and curl into lock
the hair of their head be untangle   their heart be excellently adorn with the śrīvatsa motif
the marking on their palm and sol blaze with splendor
they be endow with marking as if they be draw in the color of vermilion realgar minium indigo bark and verdigris
su­bhūti these constitute the eighty minor mark
excellently adorn with these mark the body of the tathāgata radiantly shine
all these be the causal and fruitional attribute which be to be perfect by great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
instruct and advise other bodhisattva as follow come child of enlighten heritage
may you become skilled in the formation of syllable
that be to say may you become skilled in the formation of a single syllable
may you become skilled in the formation of two syllable
similarly may you become skilled in the formation of three four five six seven eight nine ten and similarly twenty thirty forty and up to fifty up to a hundred syllable and up to a thousand syllable
through a single syllable may you realize all the natural expression of speech
similarly may you realize all the natural expression of speech on the basis of two three and up to a hundred and a thousand syllable
similarly may you gather the forty two basic syllable in a single syllable
may you gather a single syllable within the forty two syllable
in this way su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being should gather the forty two syllable in a single syllable
and they should gather a single syllable within the forty two syllable
having master the forty two syllable by mean of a single syllable
and similarly having master a single syllable by mean of the forty two syllable
they become skilled in the formation of syllable
having master the formation of syllable
they then become skilled in the formation of speech that be without syllable
for example the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be skilled in the sacred doctrine and skilled in syllable
and they teach through syllable the sacred doctrine that be without syllable
indeed su­bhūti there be no doctrine at all that be not include in the syllable and the absence of syllable
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if owe to the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
sentient being too be never apprehensible and
nor indeed be the sacred doctrine apprehensible and
nor be even the natural expression of the sacred doctrine apprehensible
then venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being who practice the six transcendent-perfection and
similarly practice the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption and
likewise the thirty seven branch of enlightenment the fourteen aspect of emptiness
the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
the eight aspect of liberation the nine serial step of meditative absorption
the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment
great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being by mean of the six transcendent-perfection which originate from the ripen of past action
similarly how do they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being by mean of the six extrasensory power which originate from the ripen of past action
sentient being and the designation sentient being be non apprehensible
since sentient being be non apprehensible the psycho physical aggregate sensory element and sense field be non apprehensible
similarly since sentient being be non apprehensible the six transcendent-perfection be non apprehensible
and in the same vein all the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be non apprehensible
the eighty minor mark be non apprehensible
since sentient being be non apprehensible nothing be designate as a sentient being
nothing be designate as the psycho physical aggregate the sensory element and the sense field
and in the same vein nothing be designate as the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighty minor mark
this be the case venerable lord how would great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
venerable lord would n’t those great-bodhisattva-being encourage sentient being to acquire attribute that be non existent and
would n’t this cause they to engage in or identify with erroneous view
if one be to ask why
venerable lord it be because if those great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do not apprehend even the nature of a bodhisattva
how could they possibly apprehend the attribute that be the aspect of enlightenment
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so it be exactly as you have say
su­bhūti it be because sentient being be non apprehensible
that one should know the emptiness of internal phenomenon
and likewise the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon
the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality
the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thing
the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic and similarly the emptiness of the psycho physical aggregate
the emptiness of the sense field the emptiness of the noble truth
the emptiness of dependent origination the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
the emptiness of condition phenomenon and of unconditioned phenomenon
the emptiness of the self the emptiness of sentient being and the emptiness of living creature
in the same way one should know life individual humankind human being actor instigator experiencer knower and viewer to be emptiness
similarly one should know the meditative concentration the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption to be emptiness and also the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path to be emptiness
similarly one should know emptiness to be emptiness signlessness to be emptiness and aspirationlessness to be emptiness
similarly one should know the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative absorption to be emptiness
similarly one should know the ten power of the tathāgata to be emptiness and likewise the four assurance to be emptiness the four unhindered discernment to be emptiness great loving kindness to be emptiness great compassion to be emptiness and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha to be emptiness
similarly one should know the fruit of enter the stream to be emptiness and the other fruit up to and include the fruit of arhatship to be emptiness and individual enlightenment to be emptiness the maturity of the bodhisattvas to be emptiness genuinely perfect enlightenment to be emptiness the buddhafield to be emptiness and the maturation of sentient being to be emptiness
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
having see all thing as emptiness
teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being who have be captivate by erroneous view but
they do not apprehend those sentient being at all
they teach this sacred doctrine without transgress those aspect of emptiness at all
perceive in this way they know all thing to be without obscuration and then
without disturb anything at all and without dualize they indeed teach this sacred doctrine exactly as it be
su­bhūti just as when an emanation of the tathāgata project many thousand of phantom
some of whom engage in generosity some in ethical discipline some in tolerance some in perseverance some in meditative concentration and some in wisdom
while some engage in the immeasurable aspiration some in the formless absorption and some in the extrasensory power
do you think su­bhūti that that emanation would have detail anything at all
no venerable lord
the blessed one continue
for these reason su­bhūti you
should know
that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
establish sentient being on the bodhisattva level just as they teach the sacred doctrine to they and
release they from erroneous view by mean of that which be neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because physical form be naturally neither fetter nor liberated
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be naturally neither fetter nor liberated
nor do the non bondage and non liberation of physical form constitute physical form
similarly the non bondage and non liberation of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness do not constitute consciousness and the aforementioned aggregate
su­bhūti it be because physical form and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be absolutely pure
the same apply also to all condition and unconditioned phenomenon
so it be su­bhūti that although great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being they do not apprehend sentient being
su­bhūti it be because those great-bodhisattva-being abide in a non abiding manner in the non apprehension of all thing
they abide in a non abide manner with respect to the emptiness of physical form and similarly with respect to the emptiness of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and they abide in a non abide manner with respect to the emptiness of condition and unconditioned phenomenon
su­bhūti in no respect do they abide in condition and unconditioned phenomenon or in the emptiness of condition phenomenon
it be because those phenomenon and those aspect of emptiness be without essential nature and without apprehension in which one might abide
su­bhūti non entity do not at all abide in non entity
intrinsic entity do not abide in intrinsic entity nor do extraneous entity abide in extraneous entity
intrinsic entity do not abide in intrinsic entity
nor do extraneous entity abide in extraneous entity
if you ask why
it be because they be all non apprehensible and where could that which be non apprehensible abide
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
thoroughly cultivate these attribute owe to all the aforementione aspect of emptiness
the lord buddhas great-bodhisattva-being the pratyekabuddha
the śrāvaka of the tathāgata and all sublime being be all without defect
su­bhūti it be because those lord buddhas great-bodhisattva-being pratyekabuddhas
and śrāvaka of the tathāgata all attain buddhahood and realization in pursuit of this reality and
they have exclusively demonstrate and continue to demonstrate all those phenomenon to sentient being without transcend the reality of those phenomenon
it be because those phenomenon do not transcend the expanse of reality the real nature and the finality of existence
it be because they be without any essential nature which might transcend
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if thing do not transcend the expanse of reality the real nature and the finality of existence
then be physical form not one thing and the expanse of reality another
the real nature another and the finality of existence another
be all the other aggregate up to and include consciousness not one thing
and mundane and supramundane phenomena another contaminate and uncontaminated phenomena another and condition and unconditione phenomenon yet another
the blessed one reply su­bhūti that be not so
venerable lord if physical form be not one thing and the expanse of reality another and
if all the other aggregate up to and include consciousness be not one thing and the expanse of reality another
up to and include condition and unconditioned phenomenon then
venerable lord how would the ripening of positive and negative past action be establish and how would they become discernible
that be to say the negative ripening of negative past action
cause sentient being to become discernible in the hell and the realm of anguished spirit and animal
the positive ripening of positive past action
cause they to become discernible in the god realm and the human realm
similarly the combined positive and negative ripening of combine positive and negative past action
likewise the neither positive nor negative ripening of neither positive nor negative past action
cause they to become discernible among the animal realm and among human being
attain the fruit of enter the stream the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti the systematic presentation of the various fruit may be disclose when the relative truth be take as the standard but
the systematic presentation of the fruit can not be disclose in ultimate truth
if you ask why
it be because in ultimate truth physical form and
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and
consciousness be without arise without cessation without affliction and without purification
this reality of the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end be non conceptual and indescribable
venerable lord if the systematic presentation of the fruit take place dependent on the relative truth
would not all ordinary people attain the fruit of enter the stream and
similarly would they not also attain the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply
and then encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
do you think su­bhūti that this illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist would have establish any sentient being in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
su­bhūti in the same manner great-bodhisattva-being establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
but they have not actually establish any sentient being at all
su­bhūti it be because commence with the reality of illusion this be in fact the reality of all thing
su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they will encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti if one be to ask in what way great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in this regard
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being abide in the ineffable transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and do not apprehend anything that may be arise ceasing afflict purify or extraneous to that extent
they will never develop thought of bewilderment and thought of carelessness
they will never develop thought of physical form
they will never develop thought of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein they will never develop thought of the transcendent-perfection of generosity thought of the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and thought of the application of mindfulness
they will never develop thought of the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and of enlightenment
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because when these great-bodhisattva-being practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they do not consider and do not apprehend anything at all since they do not apprehend they do not develop thought with regard to anything
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who have practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have acquire all the transcendent-perfection
they have elucidate all the transcendent-perfection
they have indeed possess all the transcendent-perfection
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because all the transcendent-perfection be subsume in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
for example su­bhūti just as sixty two view be subsume within the false view about perishable composite in the same way su­bhūti all the transcendent-perfection be subsume in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti do ordinary people understand the relative truth and the ultimate truth
rather they lack the establishment of the fruit of enter the stream and so on up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti it be because ordinary people lack the noble eightfold path
do not cultivate the noble eightfold path and
lack the fruit of the noble eightfold path that they do not attain the establishment of the fruit
rather su­bhūti it be the sublime individual who be endow with the path to nirvāṇa
who cultivate the path to nirvāṇa and
possess the fruit of having cultivate the path to nirvāṇa
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because those sublime individual themselves partake of the establishment of the fruit while other do not
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord be the fruit then attain when one have cultivate the path
or will one who have not cultivate the path attain the fruit
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti the fruit be not attain even when one have cultivate the path
nor will one who have not cultivate the path attain the fruit
nor su­bhūti will the fruit be attain without cultivate the path
the fruit be not attain when one lack the path nor be it when one abide on the path
in this way su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
may establish sentient being in the fruit but
the fruit be not establish by eradicate condition element or unconditioned element
venerable lord if the fruit be not establish by eradicate condition or unconditioned element
thing be not apprehend because the real nature be non apprehensible because the finality of existence be non apprehensible because emptiness be non apprehensible because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non apprehensible because the emptiness of internal phenomenon be non apprehensible and because the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be non apprehensible
similarly thing be not apprehend because the application of mindfulness be non apprehensible
thing be not apprehend because the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be non apprehensible
similarly thing be not apprehend because those who have enter the stream be non apprehensible
thing be not apprehend because other realize being up to and include genuinely perfect buddha be non apprehensible
similarly thing be not apprehend because the fruit of having enter the stream be non apprehensible
in the same vein
thing be not apprehend because the other attainment up to and include unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be non apprehensible
similarly thing be not apprehend because non arise be non apprehensible
thing be also not apprehend because other unconditioned phenomena up to and include non conditioning be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be the case that thing be not apprehend because owe to its utter purity non conditioning and so forth be non apprehensible
similarly thing be not apprehend because the first level of realization be non apprehensible
thing be not apprehend because the other level of realization up to and include the tenth level be non apprehensible owe to their utter purity
in this regard if you ask what be the ten level
they comprise
the level of bright insight   the level of buddha nature   the level of eightfold acceptance   the level of insight   the level of attenuate refinement   the level of dispassion   the level of an arhat ’s spiritual achievement   the level of the pratyekabuddha   the level of the bodhisattvas and   the actual level of the genuinely perfect buddha
in the emptiness of internal phenomenon the first level be non apprehensible
and similarly the second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth ninth and tenth level be non apprehensible
n the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity due to their utter purity the first level be non apprehensible
as be the other level up to and include the tenth level due to their utter purity
su­bhūti it be because the first level have not be be not and will not be apprehend by anyone
and the other level up to and include the tenth level owe to their utter purity have not be be not and will not be apprehend by anyone
similarly in the emptiness of internal phenomenon the maturation of sentient being be non apprehensible due to its utter purity and in to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity the maturation of sentient being be non apprehensible
similarly in the emptiness of internal phenomenon the refinement of the buddhafield be non apprehensible due to its utter purity and
in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity the refinement of the buddhafield be non apprehensible
similarly in the emptiness of internal phenomenon the five eye be non apprehensible due to their utter purity and
in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity the five eye be non apprehensible
so it be su­bhūti that when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner
owe to the non apprehension of all thing they will attain emancipation in omniscience by mean of the great vehicle
senior su­bhūti then say to the blessed one
venerable lord this great vehicle which be call the great vehicle overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
venerable lord as i understand the word speak by the blessed one
this great vehicle be equal to space
just as in space come go and abide be not discernible
so in this great vehicle also come go and abide be not discernible
just as in space the limit of the past be non apprehensible and
the limit of the future and the intervene present be non apprehensible
so in this great vehicle also the limit of the past be non apprehensible and the limit of the future and the intervene present be non apprehensible
it be because it genuinely transcend the three time that this vehicle be call the great vehicle
the blessed one then reply to senior su­bhūti
that be so su­bhūti
it be just as you have say
this vehicle be equal to space
that be why it overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
su­bhūti this vehicle of the bodhisattvas comprise the six transcendent-perfection
if you ask what these six be they be
the transcendent-perfection of generosity the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti these designate the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
moreover su­bhūti this great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being comprise the emptiness of internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature with respect to non entity
moreover this great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being comprise all the gateway of mnemonic incantation and all the gateway of meditative stability
the latter include the meditative stability name heroic valor and the other hundred and ten meditative stability up to and include the meditative stability name unattached liberated and uncover like space
moreover su­bhūti this great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being comprise
the four application of mindfulness and in the same vein all the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
it also comprise the ten power of the tathāgata and all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
also su­bhūti you say that this vehicle overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
what you may ask be this world with its god human and antigod
it comprise
the world system of desire the world system of form and the world system of formlessness
su­bhūti if the world system of desire be endow with attribute that be unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative permanent stable eternal and unchanging and
it be not a non entity then this supreme great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
its attribute be impermanent unstable ephemeral changeable and so on and
however su­bhūti because this world system of desire be imagine fabricate and verbally construct
because it be a non entity this supreme great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
similarly su­bhūti if the world system of form and the world system of formlessness be endow with attribute that be unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative permanent stable eternal and unchanging and
they be not non entity
then this supreme great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
however su­bhūti because the world system of form and the world system of formlessness be imagine fabricate and verbally construct
their attribute be impermanent unstable ephemeral changeable and so on and
because they be non entity this supreme great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
su­bhūti if physical form be endow with attribute that be unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative entirely permanent stable eternal and unchanging and
however su­bhūti because physical form be imagine fabricate and verbally construct their attribute be entirely impermanent unstable ephemeral changeable and so on and
because they be non entity this supreme great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
the same refrain should be extensively apply to feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness just as it have be apply to physical form
similarly if the eye ear nose tongue body and mental faculty and
similarly the sense field of sight the sense field of sound the sense field of odor the sense field of taste the sense field of tangible and the sense field of mental phenomenon and
similarly visual consciousness and so on up to the mental faculty that arise from visually compound sensory contact
and similarly the feeling originate from sensory contact that be visually compound and so on up to the feeling arise from sensory contact that be mentally compound
be all endow with attribute that be unmistaken inalienable incontrovertible genuine true qualitative permanent stable eternal and unchanging and they be not non entity then
this supreme great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because all these up to and include feeling arise from sensory contact that be mentally compound be imagine fabricate and verbally construct
heir attribute be entirely impermanent unstable ephemeral changeable and so on and
su­bhūti because the expanse of reality be not an entity
su­bhūti do great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in that manner exclusively they encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti if for example an illusionist or the apprentice of an illusionist have conjure up a large gathering of people
and then encourage secure and establish sentient being one hundred billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do you think su­bhūti that this illusionist or this apprentice of an illusionist would have establish any sentient being in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti in the same manner do great-bodhisattva-being establish sentient being many hundred of billion trillion in number in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but they have not actually establish any sentient being at all
su­bhūti it be because commence with the reality of illusion this be in fact the reality of all thing
su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being have don the great armor they assume corporeal form appropriate for train sentient being who habitually engage in negative act and have regress into misconduct in all the field of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
they abide in the transcendent-perfection of generosity and in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they encourage secure and establish those being in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
and similarly they encourage secure and establish they in the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in the same vein
su­bhūti if the real nature be an entity and not a non entity and
similarly if the finality of existence and the inconceivable expanse be entity and not non entity
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because the real nature the finality of existence and the inconceivable expanse be not entity
su­bhūti if the expanse of reality be an entity and not a non entity then this supreme great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
su­bhūti if the transcendent-perfection of generosity be an entity and not a non entity
su­bhūti because the transcendent-perfection of generosity be not an entity this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
similarly su­bhūti if the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be entity and not non entity
su­bhūti because the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and so on up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not entity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
at all time they teach the sacred doctrine that be to say the six transcendent-perfection to sentient being
sentient being too on hear this sacred doctrine will never be separate from the six transcendent-perfection until they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
just as indicate here in the context of the eastern direction the same go also for all the other buddha field throughout the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
su­bhūti if the emptiness of internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be entity and not non entity
su­bhūti the passage commence with the word the illusionist or the skilled apprentice of an illusionist as indicate above along with the example give in the first part of this chapter le’u dang po be similarly applicable here
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because the emptiness of internal phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be not entity
su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
su­bhūti if the application of mindfulness be entity and not non entity
su­bhūti because the application of mindfulness be not entity
su­bhūti if the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path and in the same vein the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be entity and not non entity
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being have don the great armor and abide with a mind endow with omniscience they do not permit the development of any other mindset namely those of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
su­bhūti because all these attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be not entity
for the latter may think i must establish this many sentient being in the transcendent-perfection of generosity but i must not establish that many sentient being and so with the other transcendent-perfection up to i must establish this many sentient being in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but i must not establish that many
su­bhūti if the attribute of the level of buddha nature be entity and not non entity
similarly i must establish this many sentient being in the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the faculty the power the branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and the three gateway to liberation but i must not establish that many in all these causal attribute up to and include the three gateway to liberation
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
similarly i must establish this many sentient being in the ten power of the tathāgata and so on up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha but i must not establish that many in all these fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
su­bhūti because the attribute of the level of buddha nature be not entity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
similarly su­bhūti if the attribute of the level of eightfold acceptance the attribute of those who enter the stream the attribute of those who be tie to one more rebirth the attribute of those who be no long subject to rebirth the attribute of arhat the attribute of pratyekabuddhas the attribute of bodhisattvas and the attribute of genuinely perfect buddha be entity and not non entity
su­bhūti because the attribute of genuinely perfect buddha and so forth be not entity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti if individual who have attain the level of buddha nature be entity and not non entity
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because individual who have attain the level of buddha nature be not entity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
similarly su­bhūti if individual who have attain the level of eightfold acceptance and individual who have enter the stream who be tie to one more rebirth who be no long subject to rebirth who be arhat pratyekabuddhas bodhisattvas and genuinely perfect buddha be entity and not non entity
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because individual who have attain the level of eightfold acceptance and so on up to those individual who be tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be not entity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
su­bhūti if the world with its god human and antigod be an entity and not a non entity
su­bhūti because the world with its god human and antigod be not an entity
su­bhūti if the altruistic thought cultivate by great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment up to the time when they be seat at the focal point of enlightenment be entity and not non entity
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because the altruistic thought cultivate by great-bodhisattva-being from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment up to the time when they be seat at the focal point of enlightenment be not entity
su­bhūti if the adamantine pristine cognition of great-bodhisattva-being be an entity and not a non entity
then this supreme vehicle the great vehicle would not overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod however
su­bhūti because the adamantine pristine cognition of bodhisattvas be not an entity
this supreme vehicle the great vehicle do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
su­bhūti if the adamantine pristine cognition of great-bodhisattva-being be an entity and not a non entity
then great-bodhisattva-being after realize that all involuntary reincarnation through propensity and afflict mental state be not entity
would not have to acquire omniscience however
su­bhūti because the adamantine pristine cognition of great-bodhisattva-being be not an entity
great-bodhisattva-being after realize that all involuntary reincarnation through propensity and afflict mental state be not entity
do acquire omniscience
they do overpower and attain emancipation from the world with its god human and antigod
su­bhūti if the thirty two major mark of a superior man that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha possess be entity and not non entity

then senior ānanda say to the lord buddha
yet have the tathā­gata not reveal that the fruit of enter the stream be consequent on having renounce the three fetter
that the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
be consequent on having reduce the desire and malice associate with the world system of desire
that the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
be consequent on having renounce the five fetter associate with the low realm of desire
that arhatship be consequent on having renounce the five fetter associate with the high realm of form and formlessness
that individual enlightenment be consequent on having understand that all thing whatsoever originate from cause be thing that will cease
and that unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be consequent on having abandon involuntary reincarnation through propensity and all afflict mental state
how should i understand the venerable lord ’s statement that the fruit be not establish by eradicate condition and unconditioned phenomena
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti be the fruit of enter the stream
the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
arhatship individual enlightenment or unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment condition or unconditione
venerable lord all these phenomenon be unconditione
su­bhūti can unconditioned phenomenon then be eradicate
no venerable lord
su­bhūti when son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
realize that condition and unconditioned phenomenon have one define characteristic namely that they be without define characteristic
at that time do they eradicate anything at all that be condition or unconditione
no venerable lord
su­bhūti the reason why great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have nothing to eradicate
be that they teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being owe to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and owe to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
they themselves do not become fixate on anything at all
and they do not induce other to become fixate on anything at all
they do not become fixate on the transcendent-perfection of generosity or
similarly on the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not become fixate on the first meditative concentration or on the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration
they do not become fixate on the meditative absorption in love kindness or
on the meditative absorption in compassion empathetic joy and equanimity
similarly they do not become fixate on the absorption in the sense field of infinite space or
on the other formless absorption up to and include absorption in the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
nor do they become fixate on the application of mindfulness or the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path or on
the three gateway to liberation and in the same vein
on the fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience
since they do not become fixate on these attribute they remain unattached to anything at all
just as when the emanation of a tathāgata dispense generosity
they may indeed experience the fruit of this generosity
they may indeed experience the fruit of this generosity
but do not dwell on the fruit of this generosity
and though they may indeed practice all the six transcendent-perfection and similarly practice in accordance with contaminated uncontaminated mundane supramundane condition and unconditioned phenomenon exclusively in order that sentient being might attain final nirvāṇa
but do not dwell in anything at all
in the same way su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
may practice in accordance with all those phenomenon but
they do not dwell in they nor be they attach to anything at all
if you ask why
it be because they thoroughly realize the define characteristic of phenomenon of which all thing partake
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord if the supreme reality be that all thing be signless
sign be mere imputation that originate from imagination
then how do great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
attain distinction with regard to virtuous attribute
and how do they induce other to attain distinction with regard to virtuous attribute and
engage with they perfect the level from one to the next by mean of those virtuous attribute and
also induce sentient being to engage with the three vehicle and become establish therein
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti if great-bodhisattva-being cultivate entity or some indication of an entity and
do not cultivate non entity and signlessness
then those great-bodhisattva-being would themselves not attain distinction and
they would not induce other to engage with distinction and to become establish therein
su­bhūti if great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
and similarly the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance and the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
and if they perfect the transcendent-perfection of generosity exclusively by way of signlessness
and similarly if they perfect the meditative concentration exclusively by way of signlessness
if they perfect the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption exclusively by way of signlessness
and similarly if they meditate on and perfect the application of mindfulness
the correct exertion and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
and similarly if they perfect the meditative stability of emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness exclusively by way of signlessness
and similarly if they perfect the emptiness of internal phenomenon exclusively by way of signlessness
if they perfect the emptiness of external phenomenon exclusively by way of signlessness
and in the same vein
if they perfect the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic exclusively by way of signlessness
and similarly if they perfect the eight aspect of liberation exclusively by way of signlessness
if they perfect the nine serial step of meditative absorption exclusively by way of signlessness
and similarly if they perfect the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha exclusively by way of signlessness
then they will not be attach to those attribute owe to their exclusive signlessness
and they will also not resort to erroneous view
having cultivate these virtuous attribute
they will induce other to engage with they and to become establish in they
su­bhūti if for those great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
there be to exist an indication of phenomenon even for only the duration of a finger snap
then su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
would not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in which all thing be signless free from recollection and free from attention and they would not become establish in uncontaminated phenomenon in the real nature
su­bhūti all uncontaminated phenomenon be signless
free from recollection and free from attention
therefore su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
always act for the sake of sentient being by mean of uncontaminated phenomenon
venerable lord if all thing be signless free from recollection and free from attention
why be many different designation apply to all thing such as
these be contaminate phenomenon
these be uncontaminated these be mundane these be supramundane
these be condition these be unconditioned these be common these be uncommon
these be the attribute of śrāvakas
these be the attribute of pratyekabuddhas
these be the attribute of bodhisattva
these be the attribute of genuinely perfect buddha
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti do you think that signlessness be one thing and the attribute of the śrāvaka be another
no venerable lord
su­bhūti do you think that signlessness be one thing and the attribute of the pratyekabuddha be another
that the attribute of the bodhisattva be also another
and that the attribute of the genuinely perfect buddha be also another
well then su­bhūti do the fruit of enter the stream
the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
yes they do venerable lord yes they do venerable su­gata
arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
for these reason su­bhūti you should know that all thing be signlessness
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who train in this signlessness
be enhance by all the root of virtuous action
that be to say
they be always enhance by
the six transcendent-perfection the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration
the four formless absorption the four application of mindfulness the five faculty
the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path and
in the same vein
it be because those great-bodhisattva-being should not train in anything except emptiness signlessness and aspirationlessness
su­bhūti it be because all virtuous attribute be gather in these three gateway to liberation
emptiness as a gateway to liberation imply that all thing be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
signlessness as a gateway to liberation imply that they lack all sign
aspirationlessness as a gateway to liberation imply that they have abandon all aspiration
great-bodhisattva-being who train in these three gateway to liberation
undertake training while observe production and disintegration with respect to the five psycho physical aggregate
and likewise the twelve sense field and the eighteen sensory element
similarly they undertake training while realize the four noble truth
and they undertake training while fully comprehend the twelve link of dependent origination
then they train in the emptiness of internal phenomenon and in the emptiness of external phenomenon
and similarly they train in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of non entity and the emptiness of essential nature
and similarly they train in the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of non entity and the emptiness of essential nature
similarly they train in the six transcendent-perfection
they train in the four application of mindfulness and in the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
similarly they train in the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
for these reason venerable lord
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be the great transcendent-perfection possess by great-bodhisattva-being
venerable lord the name of the transcendent-perfection of generosity be not as well know as the name of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
nor be the name of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance and the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration as well known
similarly i must establish this many sentient being in the fruit of enter the stream
i must establish this many in the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth in the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth in arhatship and in individual enlightenment
similarly i must not establish that many in all those fruit up to and include individual enlightenment
similarly i must establish this many sentient being in omniscience but i must not establish that many
su­bhūti you should not think like that rather you should think
i should establish innumerable and countless sentient being in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and similarly in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom i should establish innumerable and countless sentient being in the application of mindfulness and so on up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti the passage commence with the word the illusionist or the skilled student of an illusionist be similarly applicable here just as have be indicate above
su­bhūti so it be that great-bodhisattva-being be say to don the great armor
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
as i investigate the teaching give by the venerable lord
on account of the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic great-bodhisattva-being alas should know that they be seek armor that be a non existent armor
if you ask why it be because physical form be empty of physical form
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of consciousness and the other aggregate
similarly the eye be empty of the eye and so with the other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty which be empty of the mental faculty
then the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha would not overpower and grace the world with its god human and antigod with their magnificence and glory however
su­bhūti because the thirty two major mark of a superior man that the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha possess be not entity
the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha do overpower and outshine the world with its god human and antigod with their magnificence and glory
su­bhūti if the luminosity of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be an entity and not a non entity
then the luminosity of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha would not pervade the world with its god human and antigod numerous as the sand of the river ganges however
su­bhūti because the luminosity of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be not an entity
the luminosity of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha do pervade the world with its god human and antigod numerous as the sand of the river ganges
su­bhūti if the voice of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha endow with its sixty aspect be an entity and
not a non entity
then the voice of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha endow with its sixty aspect would not envelop the countless innumerable world of the ten direction however
su­bhūti because the voice of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha endow with its sixty aspect be not an entity
the voice of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha endow with its sixty aspect do envelop the countless innumerable world of the ten direction
su­bhūti if the doctrinal wheel of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be an entity and
then the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha would not promulgate in the world that which have not previously be turn in conformity with the sacred doctrine by any virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else however
su­bhūti because the doctrinal wheel of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be not an entity
the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha do turn the doctrinal wheel which have not previously be turn by any virtuous ascetic brāhmin god demon brahmā or anyone else
su­bhūti if all the sentient being for whom the tathāgata turn the doctrinal wheel be entity and not non entity
then the tathāgata would not bring all those sentient being to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psycho physical aggregate be leave behind however
su­bhūti because all the sentient being for whom the tathāgata turn the doctrinal wheel be not entity
the tathāgata have indeed bring be bring and will bring all those sentient being to attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where no residue of the psycho physical aggregate be leave behind
su­bhūti you have say that this vehicle be equal to space
so it be su­bhūti it be as you have speak
this vehicle be equal to space
for example su­bhūti in space the eastern direction be not discernible
the southern direction the western direction and the northern direction be not discernible
the zenith the nadir and the four intermediate direction be also not discernible
similarly su­bhūti in this supreme vehicle the great vehicle the eastern direction be also not discernible
the zenith and the nadir be not discernible and the intermediate direction be not discernible
just as su­bhūti space be neither long nor short nor square nor round
su­bhūti the supreme vehicle the great vehicle be also neither long nor short nor square nor round
for example su­bhūti space be neither blue nor yellow nor red nor white nor crimson nor pale yellow nor golden nor multicolore
similarly su­bhūti this vehicle be also neither blue nor yellow nor red nor white nor crimson nor pale yellow nor golden nor multicolore
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space be not the past the future or the present
similarly su­bhūti this supreme vehicle the great vehicle be also not the past the future or the present
for example su­bhūti space have neither decrease nor increase and diminution be non apprehensible
similarly su­bhūti this supreme vehicle have also neither decrease nor increase and diminution be non apprehensible
for example su­bhūti space neither arise nor do it cease nor be it stable and alteration be non apprehensible
similarly su­bhūti this vehicle also neither arise nor do it cease nor be it stable and alteration be non apprehensible
for example su­bhūti space be neither virtuous nor non virtuous and it be neither determinate nor indeterminate
similarly su­bhūti this vehicle be also neither virtuous nor non virtuous and it be neither determinate nor indeterminate
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space be not something that be see nor be it hear remember or cognize
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle be also not something that be see
nor be it hear remember or cognize
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space be neither an object of knowledge nor be it an object of understanding nor be it an object of comprehension nor be it an object to be renounce nor be it an object to be actualize nor be it an object to be cultivate
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle be also neither an object of knowledge
nor be it an object of understanding
nor be it an object of comprehension
nor be it an object to be renounce
nor be it an object to be actualize
nor be it an object to be cultivate
for example su­bhūti space be neither the maturation of past action nor do it possess the attribute of maturation
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither the maturation of past action
nor do it possess the attribute of maturation
for example su­bhūti space be neither include within the world system of desire nor be it include within the world system of form nor be it include within the world system of formlessness
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle be also neither include within the world system of desire
nor be it include within the world system of form
nor be it include within the world system of formlessness
for example su­bhūti space comprise neither the attribute of desire nor the attribute of freedom from desire and in the same vein it do not comprise the attribute of the other aspect of the three poison up to and include the attribute free from delusion
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too comprise neither the attribute of desire
nor the attribute free from desire
and in the same vein
it do not comprise the attribute of the other aspect of the three poison up to and include the attribute free from delusion
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space make reference neither to the first setting of the mind on enlightenment nor do it make reference to the second the third the fourth the fifth the sixth the seventh the eighth the ninth or the tenth setting of the mind on enlightenment
similarly su­bhūti this supreme vehicle the great vehicle too make no reference to any setting of the mind on enlightenment from the first to the tenth
for example su­bhūti space be endow neither with the level of bright insight nor with the level of buddha nature nor with the level of eightfold acceptance nor with the level of insight nor with the level of attenuate refinement nor with the level of dispassion nor with the level of an arhat ’s spiritual realization nor with the level of the pratyekabuddha
similarly su­bhūti this supreme vehicle the great vehicle too be endow neither with the level of bright insight
nor with any of the other level up to and include the level of the pratyekabuddha
for example su­bhūti space be endow neither with the fruit of having enter the stream
nor with any of the other fruit up to and include that of the level of the pratyekabuddha
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be endow neither with the fruit of having enter the stream
nor with any of the other fruit up to and include that of the level of the pratyekabuddha
for example su­bhūti space be endow neither with the level of the śrāvaka
nor with the level of the pratyekabuddha
nor with the level of the genuinely perfect buddha
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be endow with neither the level of the śrāvaka
nor with the level of the genuinely perfect buddha
for example su­bhūti space be neither material nor be it immaterial
neither be it reveal nor be it unreveale
neither be it obstruct nor be it unobstructed
and neither be it associate with anything nor be it disassociate from anything
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither material
nor be it immaterial
neither be it reveal
nor be it unreveale
neither be it obstruct
nor be it unobstructed
and neither be it associate with anything nor be it disassociate from anything
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space be neither permanent nor be it impermanent
neither be it imbue with happiness nor be it imbue with suffering
and neither be it a self nor be it not a self
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither permanent nor be it impermanent
for example su­bhūti space be neither empty nor be it not empty
neither be it with sign nor be it signless
and neither do it have aspiration nor be it without aspiration
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither empty nor be it not empty
for example su­bhūti space be neither calm nor be it not calm
and neither be it void nor be it not void
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither calm nor be it not calm
for example su­bhūti space be neither darkness nor light
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither darkness nor light
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space be neither apprehensible nor be it not apprehensible
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither apprehensible nor be it not apprehensible
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for example su­bhūti space be neither expressible nor be it inexpressible
similarly su­bhūti this great vehicle too be neither expressible nor be it inexpressible
so it be that this vehicle be say to be equal to space
for these reason su­bhūti
this vehicle which be call the great vehicle be say to be equal to space
again su­bhūti you have say before that just as space accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
similarly this supreme vehicle the great vehicle also accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
that be so su­bhūti
that be so you have speak correctly
just as su­bhūti space accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
similarly su­bhūti this supreme vehicle the great vehicle too accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
one should know su­bhūti that space be non existent because sentient being be non existent
one should know that the great vehicle be non existent because space be non existent
su­bhūti for these reason this supreme vehicle the great vehicle too accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because sentient being the great vehicle and space be all non apprehensible
moreover su­bhūti one should know that space be limitless because sentient being be limitless
also one should know that the great vehicle be limitless because space be limitless
for these reason su­bhūti this supreme vehicle the great vehicle also accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because sentient being the great vehicle and space be all non apprehensible
in the same vein
su­bhūti just as all phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include the expanse of nirvāṇa accommodate countless innumerable sentient being
in the same way su­bhūti this supreme vehicle the great vehicle too accommodate countless innumerable and limitless sentient being
it be for these reason su­bhūti that this supreme vehicle the great vehicle accommodate countless innumerable and limitless sentient being
this complete the thirteenth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle like space
the blessed one then address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti you have say that this great vehicle neither come nor go and nor do it stay
su­bhūti that be so you have speak correctly
su­bhūti in this supreme vehicle the great vehicle no coming be indeed discernible
nor be go and abide discernible
su­bhūti it be because all thing be unmove for that reason they do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not even abide anywhere
su­bhūti it be because physical form do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not abide anywhere
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness also do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not abide anywhere
su­bhūti the nature of physical form do not come from anywhere it do not go anywhere and it do not abide anywhere
similarly the real nature of physical form the essential nature of physical form and the define characteristic of the essential nature of physical form do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not even abide anywhere
similarly su­bhūti the nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness do not come from anywhere do not go anywhere and do not even abide anywhere
su­bhūti the real nature of feeling the essential nature of feeling and the define characteristic of the essential nature of feeling and similarly the real nature of perception formative predisposition and consciousness the essential nature of consciousness and so forth and the define characteristic of the essential nature of consciousness and so forth
do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not even abide anywhere
su­bhūti the eye the nature of the eye the real nature of the eye the essential nature of the eye and the define characteristic of the essential nature of the eye
similarly the ear the nose the tongue the body the mental faculty the nature of the mental faculty and so forth the real nature of the mental faculty and so forth the essential nature of the mental faculty and so forth and the define characteristic of the mental faculty and so forth
su­bhūti the earth element the nature of the earth element the real nature of the earth element the essential nature of the earth element and the define characteristic of the essential nature of the earth element
similarly the water element the fire element the wind element the space element and the consciousness element along with the nature of the consciousness element and so forth the real nature of the consciousness element and so forth the essential nature of the consciousness element and so forth and the define characteristic of the essential nature of the consciousness element and so forth
do not come from anywhere they do not go anywhere and they do not even abide anywhere
su­bhūti the real nature do not come from anywhere do not go anywhere and do not even abide anywhere
su­bhūti the nature of the real nature the real nature of the real nature the essential nature of the real nature and the define characteristic of the essential nature of the real nature
do not come from anywhere do not go anywhere and do not even abide anywhere
su­bhūti the finality of existence the nature of the finality of existence the real nature of the finality of existence the essential nature of the finality of existence and the define characteristic of the essential nature of the finality of existence
su­bhūti the inconceivable expanse the nature of the inconceivable expanse the real nature of the inconceivable expanse the essential nature of the inconceivable expanse and the define characteristic of the essential nature of the inconceivable expanse

the blessed one then address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so
it be just as you have say
su­bhūti omniscience be neither create not be it condition
even the sentient being for whom great-bodhisattva-being don the great armor be uncreated and unconditioned
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord for what reason be omniscience neither create nor condition
why be the sentient being for whom great-bodhisattva-being seek the great armor uncreated and unconditioned
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti omniscience be itself neither create nor condition because its creator be non apprehensible
those sentient being too be neither create nor condition
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because physical form be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned
similarly su­bhūti the self be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned
similarly su­bhūti the other aforementione postulated subject of perception up to and include knower and viewer be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned if you ask why su­bhūti it be because the self and so forth be absolutely non apprehensible
su­bhūti dream also be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned if you ask why su­bhūti it be because they be absolutely non apprehensible
similarly echo optical aberration magical display mirage and phantom be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because they be absolutely non apprehensible
su­bhūti the emptiness of internal phenomenon be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned and in the same vein su­bhūti the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned if you ask why it be because the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity and the aforementioned aspect of emptiness be absolutely non apprehensible
similarly the causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned if you ask why su­bhūti it be because these attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be absolutely non apprehensible

if you ask why it be because those understanding up to and include omniscience be absolutely non apprehensible
su­bhūti for these reason omniscience be uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned
the sentient being for whom great-bodhisattva-being don the great armor be also uncreated undestroyed and unconditioned
su­bhūti one should know that it be for that reason that great-bodhisattva-being don the great armor
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord accord to my inquiry into the meaning of the word speak by the blessed one physical form venerable lord be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
senior pūrṇa­maitrāyaṇī­putra then address senior su­bhūti as follow
for example su­bhūti just as when the faculty of the life force have cease at the time of a man ’s death all the other sense faculty will cease
in the same way su­bhūti all the other five transcendent-perfection be subsume in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom su­bhūti if there be no transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom all these other would not be transcendent-perfection
therefore su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who wish to transcend all the transcendent-perfection should train in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom train in that which be exalt among all sentient being
if you ask why it be because they attain the unsurpassed state
su­bhūti do you think that the sentient being inhabit this world system of the great trichiliocosm be many
venerable lord the sentient being of jambu­dvīpa be many let alone the sentient being in this world system of the great trichiliocosm
the blessed one reply su­bhūti if all the sentient being in this world system of the great trichiliocosm as many as there have be throughout time have acquire a human body and all of they have then attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and a single son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have honor venerate and respect those tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha and perform all kind of service on their behalf offer for the duration of their life robe food bed mat medicine for the treatment of ailment and other resource
su­bhūti do you think that son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas would on that basis have generate much merit
venerable lord there would be many merit they would be immeasurable venerable su­gata
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti in the same vein

su­bhūti you have say that this vehicle apprehend neither the limit of past time nor do it apprehend the limit of future time or the intervene present and
that this vehicle be style the great vehicle because it remain identical throughout the three time
that be so su­bhūti that be so it be just as you have speak
this great vehicle apprehend neither the limit of past time nor do it apprehend the limit of future time or the intervene present
indeed this vehicle be call the great vehicle because it remain identical throughout the three time
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because past time be empty of the past
future time be empty of the future
and the present time be empty of the present
the sameness of the three time be empty of the sameness of the three time
the great vehicle be empty of the great vehicle
the bodhisattva be empty of the bodhisattva
su­bhūti emptiness be not one not two not three not four not five but nor be it anything else
su­bhūti this be the vehicle of the bodhisattvas which maintain sameness throughout the three time
it do not apprehend concept of same and not same
it do not apprehend desire and dispassion

it be because non entity be non apprehensible
su­bhūti past physical form be empty of past physical form
future physical form be empty of future physical form
present physical form be empty of present physical form
similarly past feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of past consciousness and so forth
future consciousness be empty of future consciousness
present consciousness be empty of present consciousness
su­bhūti in emptiness past physical form be non apprehensible
the past itself be emptiness and
they be non apprehensible because emptiness be indeed emptiness so
how could past physical form be apprehend in emptiness
in emptiness future and present physical form be non apprehensible
how could future and present physical form be apprehend in emptiness
in emptiness past feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non apprehensible
how could past feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be apprehend in emptiness
in emptiness future and present feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non apprehensible
how could future and present feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be apprehend in emptiness
similarly su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection of generosity do not apprehend the limit of past time
likewise the transcendent-perfection of generosity do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection of generosity do not apprehend the sameness of the three time
su­bhūti in the sameness of thing past time be non apprehensible
nor be the future and the present apprehensible
su­bhūti sameness do not apprehend sameness even provisionally so
so how could past time be apprehend in sameness
similarly how could future and present time be apprehend
su­bhūti the same refrain should be extensively apply also to the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom just as in the case of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
moreover su­bhūti the application of mindfulness do not apprehend the limit of past time
similarly the application of mindfulness do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present
the application of mindfulness do not apprehend the sameness of the three time
in the same vein
the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path do not apprehend the limit of past time
similarly the noble eightfold path and so forth do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present
the noble eightfold path and so forth do not apprehend the sameness of the three time

similarly the ten power of the tathāgata do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present
the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha do not apprehend the limit of past time
similarly the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and so forth do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present
the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and so forth do not apprehend the sameness of the three time
moreover su­bhūti ordinary people do not apprehend the limit of past time
similarly ordinary people do not apprehend the limit of future time or the present
ordinary people do not apprehend the sameness of the three time
if you ask why
it be owe to the non apprehension of sentient being
śrāvakas do not apprehend the limit of past time
śrāvakas do not apprehend the limit of future time
śrāvakas do not apprehend the present
similarly śrāvakas do not apprehend the sameness of the three time
if you ask why
it be owe to the non apprehension of sentient being
similarly the pratyekabuddha and likewise the bodhisattvas and the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha do not apprehend the limit of past time
the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and so forth do not apprehend the limit of future time nor the present time
similarly the tathāgata and so forth do not apprehend the sameness of the three time
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
having train accordingly with respect to the three time
should perfect omniscience
su­bhūti this be the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being designate as the sameness of the three time
abide therein great-bodhisattva-being overpower the world with its god human and antigod and
they attain emancipation in omniscience
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord well indeed have the lord teach the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being of the past who have train in this supreme vehicle have attain omniscience
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being of the future also having train in this supreme vehicle the great vehicle will acquire omniscience
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being of the present who be limitless in number reside in the innumerable countless and limitless world system of the ten direction having train in this supreme vehicle the great vehicle currently acquire omniscience
venerable lord that be why this be the great vehicle of great-bodhisattva-being
the blessed one then reply to senior su­bhūti
su­bhūti that be so su­bhūti that be so it be as you have say
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being of the past who have train in this great vehicle have attain omniscience
the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who will appear in the future also having train in this great vehicle will acquire omniscience
senior su­bhūti be physical form neither fetter nor liberate
similarly be feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness neither fetter nor liberate
senior pūrṇa that be the case physical form be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
then senior pūrṇa address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti what be those physical form that be neither fetter nor liberate
similarly what be the feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness that be neither fetter nor liberate
senior pūrṇa physical form which resemble dream be neither fetter nor liberated
likewise feeling which resemble dream perception which resemble dream formative predisposition which resemble dream and consciousness which resemble dream be neither fetter nor liberated
in the same vein physical form which resemble echo and the other aggregate up to and include consciousness which resemble echo be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly senior pūrṇa physical form that resemble optical aberration magical display mirage and phantom be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness that resemble phantom and the like be neither fetter nor liberated
senior pūrṇa physical form of the past be neither fetter nor liberate
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness of the past be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly senior pūrṇa physical form of the future be neither fetter nor liberate
and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness of the future be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly senior pūrṇa physical form of the present be neither fetter nor liberate
and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness of the present be neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why physical form be neither fetter nor liberate because they be non existent
similarly consciousness and all the other aggregate be neither fetter nor liberate because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non existent
similarly physical form be all neither fettered nor liberate because physical form be void
similarly consciousness and all the other aggregate be neither fetter nor liberate because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be void
similarly physical form be all neither fettered nor liberate because physical form be non arising similarly consciousness and all the other aggregate be neither fetter nor liberate because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non arising
similarly physical form be all neither fettered nor liberate because physical form be uncease
similarly consciousness and all the other aggregate be neither fetter nor liberate because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be uncease
likewise senior pūrṇa virtuous physical form be neither fetter nor liberate
similarly virtuous feeling virtuous perception virtuous formative predisposition and virtuous consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
likewise non virtuous physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly non virtuous feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
likewise indeterminate physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly indeterminate feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
in the same vein mundane physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly mundane feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
supramundane physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly supramundane feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
contaminate physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly contaminate feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
uncontaminated physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly uncontaminated feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why physical form be neither fettered nor liberated and similarly why feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither fetter nor liberated it be because physical form be non existent and because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non existent
similarly physical form and the other aggregate up to and include consciousness be neither fetter nor liberate because they be void because they be non arising and unceasing and because they be not fetter and not bind
senior pūrṇa all thing be neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why all thing be neither fetter nor liberate because all thing be non existent
similarly all thing be neither fetter nor liberate because all thing be void because they be non arising because they be uncease because they be not fetter and because they be not bind
senior pūrṇa the transcendent-perfection of generosity be also neither fetter nor liberated
similarly senior pūrṇa the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be also neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why the transcendent-perfection of generosity be neither fetter nor liberate because it be non existent similarly the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be neither fetter nor liberate because they be non existent
senior pūrṇa the emptiness of internal phenomenon be also neither fetter nor liberated and similarly the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly the application of mindfulness the correct exertion the support for miraculous ability
the five faculty the five power the seven aspect of enlightenment
the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation the ten power of the tathāgata
and in the same vein all other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be also neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why those attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be neither fetter nor liberate because they themselves be non existent because they themselves be void because they themselves be unfettered and because they themselves be unliberated
senior pūrṇa enlightenment too be neither fetter nor liberated similarly senior pūrṇa the understanding of all phenomenon the understanding of the aspect of the path omniscience and the bodhisattva be also neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why they be neither fetter nor liberate because they themselves be non existent because they themselves be void because they themselves be non arising because they themselves be non ceasing and so on even up to the attainment of buddhahood
senior pūrṇa the real nature the inalienable real nature reality the expanse of reality the abide nature of phenomenon the maturity of the bodhisattvas the finality of existence and other unconditioned phenomenon be also neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why these phenomenon up to and include unconditioned phenomenon be neither fetter nor liberate because they be themselves non existent because they be themselves void because they be themselves non arising because they be themselves unceasing because they be themselves not fetter and because they be themselves not liberate
senior pūrṇa in this regard the transcendent-perfection of generosity possess by great-bodhisattva-being be neither fetter nor liberated
the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the attainment up to and include omniscience be also neither fetter nor liberated
the same refrain should be apply here as have be indicate in the precede part of this chapter
if you ask why
it be because dream and similarly echo optical aberration mirage magical display or phantom be the erroneous misconception of ordinary people
su­bhūti since all thing be unactualized and unoriginated
how could great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom acquire the notion of an entity or the notion of genuine origination or the notion of something that be authentic
the innumerable tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who be alive at present reside in the innumerable countless and limitless world of the ten direction also
having train in this great vehicle now acquire omniscience
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
how do they investigate these phenomenon
senior su­bhūti what be a great bodhisattva be
what be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
what be their investigation
senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra you ask what be a bodhisattva
the term bodhisattva designate one who be simply an enlightened being
on the basis of enlightenment such being know the modality of all thing but
they be not at all fixate on those phenomenon
what be the modality of all thing that they know the phenomenon on which they be not fixate
they know the modality of physical form and yet
they be without fixation in that respect
similarly they know the modality of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and yet they be without fixation on they
in the same vein as before
they know the modality of other phenomenon up to and include the sense field and yet they be without fixation on they
similarly they know the modality of the sensory element and yet
similarly they know the modality of the sensory element and yet
similarly they know the modality of the application of mindfulness and yet
in the same vein
they know the modality of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and likewise of the ten power of the tathāgata and in the same vein of all the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha and yet
senior su­bhūti what constitute the modality of all thing that great-bodhisattva-being know the thing on which they be not fixate
senior śāradvatī­putra the modality indication and sign whereby phenomenon be grasp that be to say
the sight sound odor taste tangible mental phenomenon external and internal attribute and so forth through which condition and unconditioned thing be grasp constitute the modality that they definitively know
senior śāradvatī­putra you also ask what be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it be the intelligence that be far removed
this be why it be call the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
from what be it far removed
śāradvatī­putra it be far removed from the psycho physical aggregate the sensory element and the sense field
it be far removed from all afflict mental state and opinion
it be far removed from the six class of live being
this be why it be call the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
t be far removed from the transcendent-perfection of generosity and from the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline tolerance perseverance and meditative concentration
it be far removed from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly it be far removed from the emptiness of internal phenomenon and it be far removed from the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
it be far removed from the application of mindfulness and the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and from the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
it be far removed from the understanding of all phenomenon from the understanding of the aspect of the path and from omniscience
senior śāradvatī­putra for these reason it be far removed
senior śāradvatī­putra you also ask what constitute investigation
senior śāradvatī­putra in this context when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they do not investigate the notion that physical form be imbue with happiness
nor do they investigate the notion that physical form be imbue with suffering or that they be not imbue with suffering or indeed that they be not imbue with happiness or that they be permanent or impermanent
in the same vein as mention previously
they do not investigate the notion that physical form be a self or not a self empty or not empty with sign or signless have aspiration or lack aspiration calm or not calm void or not void and so on
similarly they do not investigate the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be a self in the same vein
they do not investigate those other notion include the notion that these be void or not void
the same refrain should be apply to the transcendent-perfection of generosity and also it should be apply to the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly it should be apply to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and to the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly it should be apply to the application of mindfulness and to the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path and to the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly it should be apply to all phenomenon and in the same way it should be apply to all the gateway of meditative stability and to all the gateway of mnemonic incantation
similarly they do not investigate the notion that omniscience be permanent or impermanent and similarly the notion that it be imbue with happiness or suffering that it be not imbue with suffering or happiness that it be a self or not a self that it be empty or not empty that it be with sign or signless that it be have aspiration or lack aspiration that it be calm or not calm and that it be void or not void
senior śāradvatī­putra when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they investigate all thing in that manner
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti why do you say that the non arising of physical form be not physical form and that the non arise of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and so forth
similarly why do you say that the non arising of all thing up to and include omniscience be not omniscience and so forth
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra physical form be empty of physical form
senior śāradvatī­putra the emptiness of physical form be not physical form and
nor be there arise of physical form
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra the non arising of physical form be not physical form
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of consciousness and the other aggregate
senior śāradvatī­putra the emptiness of these aggregate be not consciousness and so forth and
nor be there arise of consciousness and so forth
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra the non arise of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and the other aggregate
senior śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection of generosity be empty of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
emptiness be not the transcendent-perfection of generosity there be no arise
in the same vein as before
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be empty of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
emptiness be not the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth]—there be no arise
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra the non arise of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the same refrain should be also extensively apply as before to the emptiness of internal phenomenon and so forth
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra the non arising of physical form be not physical form indeed there be no arise
similarly the non arise of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and the other aggregate
indeed there be no arise
similarly the non arising of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be not omniscience and the rest]—indeed there be no arise
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti why do you say that the imperishability of physical form be not physical form
similarly why do you say that the imperishability of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and the other aggregate
in the same vein
why do you say that the imperishability of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be not omniscience and the rest
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra all thing that be imperishable that constitute physical form and that be without duality
be neither conjoin nor disjoin and
they share a single define characteristic in that they be all immaterial unrevealed unimpeded and without define characteristic
similarly all those thing that be imperishable that constitute feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and that be without duality
the same refrain should also be apply to the sensory element and sense field exactly as indicate here in the context of the psycho physical aggregate
similarly it should be extensively apply to all the other attribute and attainment as well up to and include omniscience
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra the imperishability of physical form be not physical form
similarly the imperishability of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and the other aggregate
similarly the imperishability of all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be not omniscience and the rest
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
it would not be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom if one be to apprehend its essential nature or likewise if one be to apprehend its actualization or genuine origin
so it be that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not attach to physical form and similarly they be not attach to the other aggregate up to and include consciousness
similarly they be not attach to the world system of desire they be not attach to the world system of form and they be not attach to the world system of formlessness
similarly they be not attach to any of the meditative concentration the gateway to liberation the meditative stability or the formless absorption
they be not attach to the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment
they be not attach to the three gateway to liberation
they be not attach to the six transcendent-perfection
they perfect the first bodhisattva level without any longing for it arise
if you ask why
since they do not apprehend even that first level how could long for it arise
similarly they perfect the other bodhisattva level up to and include the tenth level without any longing for they arise
since they do not apprehend those bodhisattva level up to and include the tenth level how could long for they arise
just as they do not apprehend this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom while practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
so when practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they perceive that all thing be gather within this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
but they do not apprehend any of those thing
it be because these thing and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non dual and indivisible
there be no particular at all with respect to any thing
indeed all thing have an undifferentiated nature because they denote the expanse of reality and because they denote the finality of existence
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord since all thing be undifferentiated how be thing establish as virtuous or non virtuous specify or unspecified
similarly how be thing establish as contaminate or uncontaminated as mundane or supramundane and as condition or unconditioned
the blessed one reply
virtuous or non virtuous specify or non specified contaminate or uncontaminated mundane or supramundane condition or unconditione
su­bhūti do you think that with regard to the reality of all thing there exist the description of anything
or similarly pertain to the fruit of enter the stream or the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth or the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth or arhatship individual enlightenment or genuinely perfect enlightenment
no venerable lord
the blessed one reply
for that reason su­bhūti you should know that all thing be undifferentiated without define characteristic and they neither arise nor cease
from physical form feeling perception formative predisposition consciousness condition phenomenon unconditioned phenomenon
su­bhūti formerly when i engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva
i do not apprehend the essential nature of anything at all
or the fruit of enter the stream and so on up to and include genuinely perfect enlightenment
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they be seat at the focal point of enlightenment should be skillful with regard to the essential nature of all thing
skillful with regard to the essential nature of all thing great-bodhisattva-being refine the path to enlightenment
and also bring sentient being to maturation refine the buddhafield attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
and then in various way they instruct sentient being so that they will no long wander in the three impure realm subject to rebirth
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should train accord to this approach which be without define characteristic
thereupon senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord since all thing be dreamlike non entity with the essential nature of non entity and empty of intrinsic define characteristic
how then can it be establish that these be virtuous phenomenon those be non virtuous phenomenon
these be specify those be non specified these be contaminate those be uncontaminated these be mundane those be supramundane these be condition phenomenon those be unconditioned phenomenon
these attribute actualize the fruit of enter the stream
these actualize the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth
these actualize the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth
these actualize the fruit of arhatship
these be conducive to individual enlightenment
and these attribute be conducive to genuinely perfect enlightenment
similarly in the manner of thing that be dreamlike
with regard to thing that resemble an echo
thing that resemble an optical aberration
that resemble a mirage
and that be baseless non entity with the essential nature of non entity and empty of intrinsic define characteristic
how can it be establish that these be virtuous attribute those be non virtuous attribute and so on
how can it be establish that all these thing be conducive to genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti ordinary people who be unskille apprehend dream and they apprehend the dreamer of dream
similarly they apprehend phantom and so forth and they also apprehend the viewer of phantom and so forth
by apprehend dream and dreamer
and similarly by apprehend phantom and the viewer of phantom and so forth
they indeed actualize the formative predisposition of mistaken non virtuous action through their body speech and mind
and they also actualize the formative predisposition of virtuous action through their body speech and mind
similarly they also actualize formative predisposition of the meritorious non meritorious and neutral sort through their body speech and mind
senior su­bhūti why do you say that that which be term physical form be to be count as imperishable
all attribute and attainment up to and include that which be term omniscience be to be count as imperishable
senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra
physical form be not one thing and non arise another
the nature of non arise be indeed physical form
the nature of physical form be indeed non arising
similarly feeling too be not one thing perception be not one thing formative predisposition be not one thing consciousness be not one thing and non arise another distinct from these
the nature of consciousness be indeed non arising
the nature of non arise be indeed consciousness
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra that which be term physical form be to be count as imperishable
similarly that which be term feeling perception and formative predisposition and that which be term consciousness be to be count as imperishable
in the same vein as before
senior śāradvatī­putra omniscience be not one thing and non arise another
the nature of non arise be indeed omniscience
the nature of omniscience be indeed non arising
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra
that which be term omniscience be to be count as imperishable
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord furthermore when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be engage in the investigation of these phenomenon
owe to their utter purity they do consider the non arise of physical form
similarly owe to their utter purity they do consider the non arising of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly owe to their utter purity they do consider the non arise of a self
in the same vein owe to their utter purity they do consider the non arise of other postulate subject up to and include knower and viewer
similarly owe to their utter purity they do consider the non arising of the transcendent-perfection from the transcendent-perfection of generosity up to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and owe to their utter purity
they do consider the non arising of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
similarly owe to their utter purity
they do consider the non arise of the attribute of those who have enter the stream as well as those individual who have enter the stream the attribute of those tie to one further rebirth those individual who be tie to one further rebirth the attribute of those who be no long subject to rebirth those individual who be no long subject to rebirth the attribute of the arhat the arhat themselves the attribute of the pratyekabuddha the pratyekabuddha themselves the attribute of the bodhisattvas the bodhisattva themselves the attribute of the buddha and the buddha themselves
owe to their utter purity they do consider the non arising of the genuinely perfect buddha
and also arhat would have already attain arhatship
similarly those who follow the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha would have already attain their individual enlightenment also
great-bodhisattva-being would have absolutely attain omniscience
the five class of live being would not even be differentiate
great-bodhisattva-being would have absolutely attain the five degree of enlightenment even though they be without insight
senior su­bhūti if all thing be non arising
why should those who seek the fruit of having enter the stream cultivate the path in order to abandon the three fetter
those who seek the fruit of be tie to only one more rebirth cultivate the path in order to abandon desire hatred and delusion
those who seek the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth cultivate the path in order to abandon the five fetter associate with the low realm
those who seek the fruit of arhatship cultivate the path in order to abandon the five fetter associate with the high realm
why should pratyekabuddhas cultivate the path of individual enlightenment accord to which all formative predisposition be dependently originate
again why should great-bodhisattva-being practice austerity and undergo myriad suffering for the sake of sentient being
why should the tathāgata attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
why should the tathāgata turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra i do not hold that attainment be designate with respect to thing that be non arising
i do not hold that stream entry and the fruit of stream entry be find in non arising
similarly i do not hold that arhatship and the fruit of arhatship be find in non arising
i do not hold that the status of a pratyekabuddha and the fruit of individual enlightenment be find in non arising
su­bhūti when a son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and then retain hold recite master and be attentive to it in the correct manner and also practice it with the real nature as his or her focus that son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas would generate much great merit than the aforementioned merit
if you ask why su­bhūti it be because this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom with which great-bodhisattva-being be endow have the great benefit of attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
therefore su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who wish to become unsurpassed among all sentient being
who wish to become a protector and refuge to all those sentient being who be unprotected and without a refuge
who wish to become an ally of those who be without ally
who wish to become an eye to the blind
who wish to become a lamp for sentient being who be immerse in the darkness of fundamental ignorance
who wish to attain genuinely perfect buddhahood
who wish to pursue the perceptual range of omniscience
who wish to express themselves through the emanational display of the buddha
who wish to roar the lion ’s roar of the completely perfect buddha
i do not hold that the status of a pratyekabuddha and the fruit of individual enlightenment be find in non arising
senior śāradvatī­putra bodhisattva do not engage in the practice of austerity with the perception of hardship
if you ask why
senior śāradvatī­putra it be because when the perception of hardship be develop it will not be possible to act for the benefit of innumerable countless sentient being
on the contrary senior śāradvatī­putra once great-bodhisattva-being have develop without apprehend anything the perception of sentient being as their father the perception of sentient being as their mother the perception of sentient being as their child and the perception of sentient being as themselves
they should develop the mind of unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
just as the notion of individual self be entirely non existent in all respect and be non apprehensible
in that same manner they should develop this perception with regard to all inner and outer phenomenon
if they develop their perception in that manner
the notion of hardship will not arise
it be because in all respect in each and every way they neither acquire nor do they apprehend all these phenomenon
senior śāradvatī­putra i do not hold that the tathāgata be find in non arising
i do not hold that the unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddha be find in non arising
nor do i hold that the tathāgata turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine therein
there be nothing at all that will be attain on the basis of thing that be non arising
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti do you hold that attainment will ensue on the basis of thing that be non arising
or else do you hold that something will be attain on the basis of thing that be arise
senior śāradvatī­putra i do not hold that attainment will ensue on the basis of thing that be non arising nor do i hold that anything will be attain on the basis of thing that be arise
senior su­bhūti be there no attainment be there no clear realization
senior śāradvatī­putra there be attainment and there be clear realization but not in term of duality
yet senior śāradvatī­putra attainment and clear realization refer to worldly convention
similarly those who enter the stream be also designate accord to worldly convention
similarly the other realize being include arhat pratyekabuddhas and the unsurpassed genuinely perfect buddha too be designate on the basis of worldly convention but
ultimately there be no attainment
there be no clear realization either and there be no realize being up to and include genuinely perfect buddha
senior su­bhūti as attainment and clear realization be exclusively designate accord to worldly convention be it the case that the five class of live being be also differentiate owe to worldly convention but not in ultimate reality
senior śāradvatī­putra that be so just as attainment and clear realization be exclusively designate accord to worldly convention it be the case that the five class of live being also be differentiate owe to worldly convention but not in ultimate reality
if you ask why
senior śāradvatī­putra in ultimate reality there be no past action no ripening no affliction and no purification
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti do non arising thing arise or else do arise itself arise
senior śāradvatī­putra i do not hold that non arising thing arise
senior su­bhūti what non arising thing do you not hold to arise
senior śāradvatī­putra i do not hold the emptiness of the essential nature with respect to non arise physical form to arise
similarly i do not hold the emptiness of the essential nature with respect to unarisen feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness to arise
senior śāradvatī­putra in the same vein
i do not hold the emptiness of the essential nature with respect to any other non arising attribute up to and include enlightenment to arise
senior su­bhūti do arise arise or else do non arising arise
senior śāradvatī­putra arise do not arise nor do non arising arise
if you ask why
they abide in the transcendent-perfection of generosity that be neither fetter nor liberated they abide in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be neither fetter nor liberated
senior śāradvatī­putra it be because both thing that arise and thing that be non arise be neither conjoin nor disjoin and
in the same vein they abide in the attainment up to and include omniscience which be neither fetter nor liberated
they share a single define characteristic in that they be all immaterial unrevealed unimpeded and without define characteristic
they bring to maturity sentient being who be neither fetter nor liberated
they refine field that be exclusively neither fetter nor liberated
for these reason senior śāradvatī­putra arise do not arise nor do non arising arise
they venerate the emanation of the lord buddhas who be exclusively neither fetter nor liberated
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
they also listen to the doctrine deliver by those emanation of the lord buddhas which be neither fetter nor liberated
they will never be separate from those emanation of the lord buddhas who be neither fetter nor liberated
senior su­bhūti be you inspire to say that thing be non arising that thing be indeed non arising
they will never be separate from the extrasensory power that be neither fetter nor liberated
they will never be separate from the five eye that be neither fetter nor liberated
they will never be separate from the mnemonic incantation that be neither fetter nor liberated
senior su­bhūti be you inspire to say that the statement thing be non arising thing be indeed non arise be itself non arise
senior su­bhūti then reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra i be inspire to say that thing be non arising that thing be indeed non arising
senior śāradvatī­putra i be also inspire to say that the statement thing be non arising thing be indeed non arise be itself non arising
senior śāradvatī­putra it be because the non arising of these statement the act of inspiration the statement that be express and the thing that do not arise be all neither conjoin nor disjoin and
senior su­bhūti be it then the case that those thing be indeed non arising that the act of inspiration be also non arising that those statement be also non arising and that those comment of yours commence therefrom be also non arising
senior śāradvatī­putra it be so
it be just as you have speak
these thing be indeed non arising
the one who be inspire too be non arising
those statement too be non arising
and the thing that i be inspire to say commence therefrom be also non arising
if you ask why
senior śāradvatī­putra it be because physical form be non arising
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be non arising
similarly the eye be non arising and all other sense organ up to and include the mental faculty be non arising
similarly the earth element be non arising and all other element up to and include the element of consciousness be non arising
the formative predisposition of the body be non arising
similarly the formative predisposition of speech and the formative predisposition of mind be non arising
in the same vein
all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be non arising
senior śāradvatī­putra for these reason these aforementione statement be indeed non arising
and those thing that i be inspire to say commence therefrom be also non arising
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti you should be establish as supreme among those who teach the sacred doctrine
senior su­bhūti it be because however you be question you elaborate precisely in the correct manner
it be as you have speak because all thing be without support
then senior śāradvatī­putra again address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti what be all the thing that be without support
senior su­bhūti reply
senior śāradvatī­putra physical form be empty of inherent existence be internally without support and also they be externally without support and nor do they have any support in between those two
similarly senior śāradvatī­putra feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of inherent existence
be internally without support and also they be externally without support and nor do they have any support in between those two
in the same vein as before
the eye the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty be empty of inherent existence
similarly sight sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon be empty of inherent existence
senior śāradvatī­putra likewise the transcendent-perfection of generosity be empty of inherent existence
be internally without support
and also it be externally without support
and nor do it have any support in between those two
similarly the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and likewise wisdom be empty of inherent existence
similarly the eighteen aspect of emptiness from the emptiness of internal phenomenon up to an include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be empty of inherent existence
similarly the application of mindfulness be empty of inherent existence
similarly the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be empty of inherent existence
senior śāradvatī­putra for these reason
all thing be without support because they be empty of inherent existence
senior śāradvatī­putra it be in this way that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should refine physical form
and similarly refine feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein it be in this way that they should refine all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom after investigate condition phenomenon through the twofold emptiness and having become establish in this twofold emptiness then teach the sacred doctrine to ordinary people
what you may ask be the twofold emptiness in which they have become establish when they be teach
it comprise the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
what you may ask be the sacred doctrine that they then teach
they teach that physical form be empty of notion of i and mine
and similarly that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of notion of i and mine
who wish to beat the great drum of the sacred doctrine
who wish to blow the conch of the sacred doctrine
who wish to enunciate the sacred doctrine
and who wish to enter into the deathless expanse all of these should train in this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
great-bodhisattva-being who train in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will never grasp these great acquisition but there be never any excellence that they will not attain
venerable lord will they also attain the excellence of the śrāvaka
will they also attain the excellence of the pratyekabuddha
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti they will indeed attain the excellence of the śrāvaka and they will also attain the excellence of the pratyekabuddha
but they should not remain fix in those two mode of excellence
nor should they become dependent on they
su­bhūti having perceive they through their cognition and view they should transcend these level and enter into the maturity of the bodhisattvas
they become worthy recipient of the donation of the whole world with its god human and antigod
they swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti the bodhisattvas who train in this manner indeed approach omniscience
hey surpass all other worthy recipient of worldly donation virtuous ascetic brāhmin priest śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha and they become worthy recipient of patronage
they do not forsake the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they do not lack the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti one should know that great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in this manner possess the attribute of not regress from omniscience
they will develop the understanding of the aspect of the path that be neither fetter nor liberated
similarly the sense field be empty of notion of i and mine
similarly the sensory element be empty of notion of i and mine
o these psycho physical aggregate be like a dream like a phantom and so forth
these sense field be like a dream like a phantom and so forth
these sensory element be like a phantom and so forth
o therein the psycho physical aggregate the sense field and the sensory element do not at all exist
therein there be no dream or a dreamer of dream
there be no echo or a hearer of echo
there be no optical aberration or a viewer of optical aberration
similarly there be no viewer of mirage magical display or phantom
all thing be non entity and of the essential nature of non entity
you simply perceive psycho physical aggregate when there be no psycho physical aggregate
you perceive sensory element when there be no sensory element
you perceive sense field when there be no sense field
since all these phenomenon arise erroneously from dependent origination and have be grasp through the maturation of past action what other cause can there be for your perception of non entity as entity
great-bodhisattva-being who be skilled in mean turn miserly sentient being away from miserliness and cause they to engage in the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the dispensing of generosity by those sentient being be then conducive to great resource
but turn they away from such indulgence the bodhisattvas then commit they to ethical discipline
the adopting of ethical discipline by those sentient being be then conducive to rebirth in the high realm
but turn they away from such indulgence the bodhisattvas then commit they to the meditative stability
the meditative stability of those sentient being too be conducive to rebirth in the world of brahmā
but in the same way the bodhisattva turn they away from the first meditative concentration and establish they in the second meditative concentration
they turn they away from the second meditative concentration and establish they in the third meditative concentration
they turn they away from the third meditative concentration and establish they in the fourth meditative concentration
they turn they away from the fourth meditative concentration and establish they in the formless absorption of the sense field of infinite space
in the same vein accord to circumstance they induce and establish they in the absorption of the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
then turn they away from such indulgence the bodhisattva establish they in the three vehicle
through many way they also turn some sentient being away from the meditative concentration and the fruit of the meditative concentration
and reverse their resolve induce they to enter and become establish in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
thereupon they turn some sentient being away from generosity and the fruit of generosity
and induce they to enter and become establish in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
they turn some sentient being away from the aggregate of ethical discipline
through many way they also turn some sentient being away from the meditative stability the formless absorption the fruit of the meditative stability and the fruit of the formless absorption
they then induce some sentient being to enter and become establish in the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment the noble eightfold path the three gateway to liberation the eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
then they induce some sentient being to enter and become establish in the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
then since sentient being have contaminant which be unreveale and unimpeded they establish some of these sentient being in the fruit of enter the stream
they establish some in the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth and they establish some in the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth some in arhatship and some in individual enlightenment
they then describe and reveal the path of perfect enlightenment to those who be earnestly intent upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they encourage those sentient being and cause they to rejoice
so it be su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom determine those thing which be dreamlike those thing which be like a phantom and so forth
those thing that be non entity those that have an essential nature of non entity and those that be empty of intrinsic define characteristic
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord how wonderful it be that great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should determine
when all thing be dreamlike non entity with non entity as their essential nature and endow with the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
that these be virtuous phenomenon those be non virtuous phenomenon these be specific those be non specific these be contaminate those be uncontaminated these be mundane those be supramundane these be condition and those be unconditioned phenomenon
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti so it be
it be exactly as you have say
it be a wonderful and marvelous attribute of great-bodhisattva-being that great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom can determine how all thing be
if su­bhūti you appreciate that the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha lack the wonderful and marvelous attribute of great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
you will understand that it be consequently not easy for all the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha to repay the favor of those great-bodhisattva-being
venerable lord what be the wonderful and marvelous attribute of great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be unknown to all śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
the blessed one reply
pay attention
i will explain the wonderful and marvelous attribute of great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom abide in the six transcendent-perfection which arise through the maturation of past action
and when they be establish in the five extrasensory power the thirty seven aspect of enlightenment the gateway of mnemonic incantation the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they may traverse the world system of the ten direction
they may attract by their generosity those sentient being who be attract by generosity
and they may attract by wisdom and the other transcendent-perfection those sentient being who be attract by ethical discipline who be attract by tolerance who be attract by perseverance who be attract by meditative concentration and who be attract by wisdom
similarly they may attract by the noble eightfold path and the other causal attribute those sentient being who be attract by the four immeasurable aspiration the four meditative concentration and the four formless absorption as well as those who be attract by the four application of mindfulness the four correct exertion the four support for miraculous ability the five faculty the five power the seven branch of enlightenment and the noble eightfold path
similarly they may attract by the meditative stability of aspirationlessness and so forth those who be attract by the meditative stability of emptiness those who be attract by the meditative stability of signlessness and those who be attract by the meditative stability of aspirationlessness
su­bhūti if you ask how great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom abide in the six transcendent-perfection which arise through the maturation of past action and similarly establish in the five extrasensory power and the four unhindered discernment attract by their generosity those sentient being who be attract by generosity
it be the case su­bhūti that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom dispense their generosity toward sentient being
that be to say they give food to those who need food drink to those who need drink vehicle to those who need vehicle clothing to those who need clothing flower to those who need flower garland to those who need garland perfume to those who need perfume unguent to those who need unguent bed to those who need bed asylum to those who need asylum lamp to those who need lamp
and everything else to those who need anything else from medicine to cure the sick to all the other necessity of humankind whatever they happen to be
just as they make offering to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
they also give religious robe alm bed medicine to cure the sick and necessitie to śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha
they give flower garland perfume unguent powder parasol victory banner ribbon butter grain seed oil and lamp
just as they dispense generosity toward those who maintain ethical discipline so they also dispense generosity toward those of degenerate morality
in the same way they dispense generosity toward human being and likewise they dispense generosity toward non human being
they do not discriminate between those who be worthy recipient and those who be unworthy
rather they dispense their generosity having establish the notion that all sentient being be undifferentiated
if you ask why
since they realize that all thing be undifferentiated having comprehend and actualize this
they dispense generosity that be undifferentiated and so they attain that which be undifferentiated that be to say omniscience
su­bhūti if when great-bodhisattva-being perceive a live creature who have be bear in the animal realm
they be to think the worthy recipient of my generosity be the genuinely perfect buddha but not a live creature bear in the animal realm they would lack the attribute of a bodhisattva
it be because when their own mind be purified they also purify the worthy recipient of the bodhisattvas generosity
great-bodhisattva-being should rather think when i have attract these impoverished sentient being by my generosity
they will not steal the property of other they will be content and they will then also dispense generosity toward other
similarly when i attract they by my generosity they will not take the life of living creature
similarly when i attract they by my generosity they will not lie they will not slander they will not speak harsh word and they will not speak nonsensical word
on these basis after they have pass away they will be reborn as a householder within the royal class like a mighty sāl tree
similarly they will be reborn as a householder within the priestly class like a mighty sāl tree
they will be reborn as a householder within the householder or mercantile class like a mighty sāl tree
on this basis by mean of the vehicle of the śrāvaka the vehicle of the pratyekabuddha or the vehicle of the genuinely perfect buddha they will attain final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
but great-bodhisattva-being should not cultivate disparate thought of vacillation think perhaps i should not keep my former vow to become the protector of unprotected sentient being to become a sanctuary for those without sanctuary and to become a guide for who those without a guide
or even if other assailant or assassin be to demand the body of a great-bodhisattva-being they should not think should i give it or not give it
rather with an unagitated mind they should give their own body to those assailant and assassin
if you ask why
it be because they have indeed set out toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient being for their spiritual and temporal well being and not for the sake of their own body or life
if they be to discriminate think should i give it or not give it
then the lord buddhas great-bodhisattva-being the pratyekabuddha the other class of sublime individual apart from they and the world of god human and antigod could indeed reproach they with the word
you should keep this pledge that you make in former life when someone ask you and you vow i will become a refuge sanctuary protector ally and guide to all sentient being
they will never be separate from the mnemonic incantation that be neither fetter nor liberated
they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in omniscience that be neither fetter nor liberated
they will turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine that be neither fetter nor liberated
they will consolidate in the three vehicle sentient being who be neither fetter nor liberated
senior pūrṇa so it be that great-bodhisattva-being will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all thing by mean of the six transcendent-perfection which be neither fetter nor liberated
this be because all thing be themselves non existent because they themselves be calm because they themselves be void because they themselves be non arising and because they themselves be uncease
senior pūrṇa one should know that it be in this way that great-bodhisattva-being possess the great armor which be neither fetter nor liberated
moreover su­bhūti the great armor of great-bodhisattva-being entail the refinement of the six extrasensory power
if you ask what these six be they comprise   the extrasensory power realize knowledge of miraculous activity
the extrasensory power realize knowledge of divine clairvoyance   the extrasensory power realize knowledge of divine clairaudience
the extrasensory power realize knowledge of the mind of other   the extrasensory power realize knowledge of the recollection of past life and   the extrasensory power realize knowledge of the cessation of contaminant
su­bhūti these be the six extrasensory power of great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti if you ask what constitute the refinement of the extrasensory power realize knowledge of miraculous activity which great-bodhisattva-being have
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom experience many facet of miraculous ability
they may cause this very earth to shake
similarly having be singular in form they can become multiple and having be multiple in form they can become singular
similarly they may experience themselves as visible and as invisible
they can move directly through wall
they can move directly through enclosure
they give the level of the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha a wide berth and approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
this complete the twenty fifth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle skill in means
then su­bhūti those great-bodhisattva-being who practice accordingly do indeed practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
no one will attain emancipation through this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if they think since the expanse of reality the real nature and the finality of existence be fix state they be not the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not contain therein
if however they be to think this be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom that be subsume within this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom thereby i will attain omniscience!’—when they perceive in that way they do not practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom rather they should not perceive the nature of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom designate it with word such as this be the practice of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be contain herein when they neither perceive nor see anyone who possess the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom anything which would bring about the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom or anyone who would attain emancipation through the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and then attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment great-bodhisattva-being who practice accordingly do indeed practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then śakra mighty lord of the god think
if great-bodhisattva-being surpass sentient being while just practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom what need one say when they have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood the genuinely perfect enlightenment
if even those sentient being whose mind be just introduce to omniscience find wealth and if even those sentient being sustain themselves through noble livelihood
what need one say about those who have set their mind on the aspiration toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they can move directly through mountain without impediment as if they be move for example through space
all those other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be not as well know as the name of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow
ānanda this be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have precedence over the five other transcendent-perfection
similarly it have precedence over all those other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
ānanda do you think that a gift undedicated toward omniscience may be style as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
no venerable lord he reply
ānanda do you think that ethical discipline tolerance perseverance meditative concentration and wisdom that be undedicated toward omniscience may be style as the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and so forth
senior ānanda then ask the lord buddha
the blessed one reply
venerable lord in what way may a gift when dedicate toward omniscience be style as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
and in what way may the other transcendent-perfection up to and include wisdom when dedicate toward omniscience be style as the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest
ānanda when a gift be dedicate toward omniscience in a non dual manner
it may be style as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
when the other transcendent-perfection up to and include wisdom be dedicate toward omniscience in a non dual manner
they may be style as the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest
in the same vein
similarly when these be dedicate toward omniscience in an uncreated manner and without apprehend anything
venerable lord how be it that when a gift be dedicate toward omniscience in a non dual manner
and similarly in an uncreated manner and without apprehend anything
it may be style as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
likewise how be it that when the other transcendent-perfection up to and include wisdom be dedicate toward omniscience in a non dual manner and
the blessed one reply
similarly in an uncreated manner and without apprehend anything
they may be style as the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest
it be owe to the non duality of physical form
and similarly owe to the non duality of feeling perception formative predisposition consciousness and all other attribute up to and include enlightenment
how be it owe to the non duality of the other aggregate and of all attribute up to and include enlightenment
how be it owe to the non duality of physical form and
ānanda physical form be empty of physical form
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of consciousness and the other aggregate
in the same vein
all other attribute up to and include enlightenment be empty of enlightenment and the rest
if you ask why
it be because the transcendent-perfection and physical form be indivisible and without duality
similarly all other attribute up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and enlightenment be indivisible and without duality
ānanda so it be that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be in the vanguard of these five other transcendent-perfection and
it be in the vanguard of all other attribute up to and include omniscience
just as the seed that have be plant in a large field sprout and grow with the large field act as their support
in the same way ānanda these five other transcendent-perfection emerge dependent on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom act as their support
similarly the four application of mindfulness emerge dependent on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
as do all other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and all attainment up to and include omniscience
ānanda the five other transcendent-perfection and those other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha be dependent on omniscience
so it be ānanda that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom drive those five other transcendent-perfection and
similarly drive all those other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
senior ānanda then say to the blessed one
venerable lord the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha have not yet speak of all the quality which son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage acquire when they hold maintain recite aloud master and be attentive to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the right manner
venerable lord when they hold and be attentive and so forth to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the right manner
the path of the ten virtuous action emerge in the world
similarly the four meditative concentration the four immeasurable aspiration the four formless absorption and
other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha emerge in the world
those sentient being who have set their mind on the aspiration toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and even those who have not yet do so be to be envy when they always listen to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then śakra mighty lord of the god take coral tree flower and scatter they scatter they more vigorously and scatter they with utmost vigour toward the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha say by this merit may the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas with their high focus intent on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment perfect the attribute of the buddha
may they also perfect omniscience
may they also perfect the attribute that naturally arise and may they also perfect the attribute that be free from contaminant
venerable lord i do not in the slight think that the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will ever regress from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and become śrāvakas or pratyekabuddha
i do however think that they will long for unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and that they will aspire even more toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
see the suffering of those involve in cyclic existence they will resolve to seek the benefit of the whole world with its god human and antigod and seek to alleviate its suffering
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one

they can also emit smoke and flame of fire like a great conflagration
however miraculous powerful and mighty the sun and the moon might be they can reach out to touch they with their hand
they can even overwhelm the brahmā world realm with their physical body
yet they do not make assumption on account of such miraculous ability nor do they make assumption about those miraculous ability and they do not even apprehend they because anything on account of which they might make assumption anything about which they might make assumption and the assumption which they might make be all essentially empty essentially void and essentially non apprehensible
they focus on omniscience and apart from that have no wish to attain miraculous ability
su­bhūti such be the refinement of great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the extrasensory power that realize miraculous ability
su­bhūti if you ask what constitute the refinement of the extrasensory power realize knowledge of divine clairvoyance which great-bodhisattva-being have

su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom possess clairaudience that surpass the human range of hearing
but even though they can hear the voice of god and human they do not make assumption on account of their clairaudience
think i can hear voice and they do not even apprehend the sound that their ear hear because these be essentially empty essentially void and essentially non apprehensible they focus on omniscience and apart from that have no other wish to attain clairaudience
su­bhūti such be the refinement of great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom who possess the extrasensory power that realize clairaudience
su­bhūti if you ask what constitute the refinement of the extrasensory power realize knowledge of other mind which great-bodhisattva-being have

similarly they serve they with verbal act of love kindness and with mental act of love kindness
at that time great-bodhisattva-being acquire the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being after abide in the transcendent-perfection of generosity then acquire the transcendent-perfection of tolerance

they correctly perceive mind that be not surpass as mind that be not surpass yet they do not make assumption on account of these observation
if you ask why owe to the emptiness of inherent existence these mind be not mind
in the same vein the same refrain should be apply extensively here just as have be present above

the god in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
who have enter upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
to refine the field as well to please honor venerate respect and make offering to the tathāgata arhat and genuinely perfect buddha and they will not descend to the level of the śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha
owe to their former act of offer make to this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if you ask why
ānanda it be because those god have enter upon unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they offer shelter and protection to all sentient being
they never forsake sentient being
will decide to come there to guard protect and offer sanctuary to those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
they benefit all sentient being and
they secure they in happiness
senior ānanda then ask the blessed one
the blessed one reply to senior ānanda as follow
indeed they will know that these bodhisattva will not regress until manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment have be attain
su­bhūti such be the refined eye of the sacred doctrine possess by great-bodhisattva-being
moreover su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being know that this bodhisattva have be foreordain by the tathāgata to attain unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment
and that one have not be so foreordain
these bodhisattva will achieve their own benefit and those will not
these bodhisattva will regress and those will not
the extrasensory power of these bodhisattva be perfect while the extrasensory power of those one be unperfected
this bodhisattva with perfect extrasensory power
will proceed to honor praise venerate respect and make offering to the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha in the world system of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
this bodhisattva will attain the extrasensory power and that one will not
this bodhisattva will refine the field in which enlightenment be attain and that one will not
this bodhisattva have bring sentient being to maturity and that one have not
these bodhisattva stand alongside and will stand alongside the lord buddhas but those do not and will not
the lifespan of this bodhisattva who have attain enlightenment will be estimable
and the lifespan of that bodhisattva who have attain enlightenment will be innumerable
the monastic community of this bodhisattva who have attain enlightenment will be estimable
while the monastic community of that one will be innumerable
the bodhisattva community of this bodhisattva who have attain enlightenment will be estimable
this bodhisattva will engage in austerity and that one will not
this bodhisattva be in his final rebirth and that one be not
this bodhisattva be praise by the lord buddhas throughout the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
this bodhisattva will come to sit upon the seat of enlightenment and that one will not
this bodhisattva will withstand the demonic force and that one will not
su­bhūti such be the refined eye of the sacred doctrine possess by great-bodhisattva-being
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the refined eye of the buddha possess by great-bodhisattva-being
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being immediately after attain the mind set on enlightenment become absorb in adamantine meditative stability and then attain omniscience
they be endow with the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment
great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
with regard to all thing in all their aspect there be nothing at all that the eye of the buddha possess by great-bodhisattva-being
do not see hear recall or perceive with extrasensory power
su­bhūti such be the refined eye of manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed and genuinely perfect enlightenment possess by great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti these be the five extremely refined eye of great-bodhisattva-being
su­bhūti the refinement of these five eye possess by great-bodhisattva-being should be know as don the great armor
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one as follow
venerable lord in what thing should great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom abide
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in anything at all
if you ask why it be because the act of abide the abider and that in which they would abide be non apprehensible
venerable lord accord to my inquiry into the meaning of the word speak by the blessed one
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in physical form
similarly they should not abide in feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they should not abide in the eye similarly they should not abide in the ear the nose the tongue the body and the mental faculty
similarly they should not abide in sight
similarly they should not abide in sound odor taste tangible and mental phenomenon
they should not abide in visual consciousness and they should not abide in the other aspect of consciousness up to and include mental consciousness
in the same vein they should not abide in the sensory element up to and include the sensory element of phenomena
they should not abide in sensory contact that be visually compound
they should not abide in feeling that be visually compound and they should not abide in the other aspect of feeling up to and include feeling due to sensory contact that be mentally compound
they should not abide in the earth element they should not abide in the water element the fire element and the wind element
they should not abide in the space element they should not abide in the consciousness element they should not abide in fundamental ignorance and they should not abide in the other link of dependent origination up to and include aging and death
if one be to ask why venerable lord it be because physical form be empty of physical form
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be empty of consciousness and the other aggregate
venerable lord the emptiness of physical form be not physical form and physical form do not exist elsewhere apart from the emptiness of physical form this be because the nature of physical form be also emptiness and emptiness indeed be physical form
moreover ānanda if those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage smell the perfusive scent of non human being
and that the god extend as far as the akaniṣṭha realm
venerable lord how can those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage know that among all the world system of the ten direction the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm will come here
will also come here to examine this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and to hold retain venerate make offering to and respect it
ānanda if those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage behold an extensive aura of light around the place where this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have be place
they should certainly know that eminently powerful god endow with great occult power and great miraculous ability will have arrive to examine this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and to hold retain venerate make offering to and respect it
they should certainly know that god endow with great occult power and great miraculous ability
will have arrive there to examine this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and to hold retain master pay homage to make offering to and respect it
moreover ānanda if those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage always maintain scrupulous conduct and make offering
to this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in accordance with the correct procedure
on account of their scrupulous conduct many god will arrive there and rejoice
upon examine this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and upon hold master honor retain venerate respecting and make offering to it
god of feeble power who be previously present in that place
and so they will consider leave that place
will be unable to bear the majesty the glory and the exaltedness of those eminently powerful god endow with great occult power and great miraculous ability
the more those eminently powerful god endow with great occult power
and great miraculous ability think they should come there
the more the volition of those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will be enhance
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have not be produce by mind
it have not be produce by physical form not by feeling not by perception not by formative predisposition and not by consciousness
in the same vein as before it have not be produce by the application of mindfulness
it have not be produce by the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
it have not be produce by the ten power of the tathāgata
similarly it have not be produce by the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
this complete the eighteenth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle purity
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be an agent that have no action
the blessed one reply
this be because it be non apprehensible as an agent
because it be non apprehensible in term of all phenomenon and so forth
venerable lord
how then should great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be an agent that have no action
in the same vein
similarly they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be permanent or that they be impermanent
they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that physical form be imbue with happiness or that they be imbue with suffering
they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with physical form
they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly
it have not be produce by the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha

similarly
whenever they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness cease or that they be uncease
whenever they do not engage with the notion that physical form be pure or that they be impure
whenever they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be pure or that they be impure
they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
whenever they do not engage with the notion that all attainment up to and include omniscience be permanent or that they be impermanent and that all fruitional attribute up to and include the five eye be pure or that they be impure
if you ask why
it be because when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not consider the notion that physical form be permanent or that they be impermanent
similarly they do not consider the notion that they be imbue with happiness or that they be imbue with suffering that they be a self or that they be not a self that they be empty or that they be not empty that they be with sign or that they be signless that they have aspiration or that they be without aspiration that they be calm or that they be not calm that they be void or that they be not void that they be afflict or that they be purify that they arise or that they be non arising that they cease or that they be unceasing that they be entity or that they be non entity or that they be pure or impure

moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
whenever they do not engage with the notion that physical form be perfect or that they be not perfect
if you ask why
it be because when they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they do not apprehend and do not consider physical form
they do not apprehend and do not consider feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
they do not apprehend and do not consider any attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord how wonderful be the lord buddha ’s eloquent exegesis of these aspect of attachment and non attachment possess by the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who espouse the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have say
the aspect of attachment and non attachment possess by those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who espouse the vehicle of the bodhisattvas have be eloquently explain by the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
similarly they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be perfect or that they be not perfect
they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be perfect or that they be not perfect
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that physical form be with attachment or that they be without attachment
similarly they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be with attachment or that they be without attachment
similarly they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom whenever they do not engage with the notion that the eye ear nose tongue body and mental faculty be with attachment or that they be without attachment

whenever they do not engage with the notion that all attainment up to and include omniscience be with attachment or that they be without attachment
su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being practice in that manner
they understand that physical form be neither with attachment nor be they without attachment
they understand that the fruit of enter the stream be neither with attachment nor be it without attachment
in the same vein
similarly they understand that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be neither with attachment nor be they without attachment
similarly they understand that the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth the fruit of arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be neither with attachment nor be they without attachment
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord how wonderful it be that this profound sacred doctrine be neither diminish even when it be not explain nor be it enhance even when it be explain
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have say
this profound sacred doctrine be neither diminish even when it be not explain nor be it enhance even when it be explain
just as su­bhūti if the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha be to eulogize space for the duration of their entire life
space would neither be diminish even when it be not eulogize nor would it be enhance even when it be eulogize
in the same way su­bhūti an illusory person be neither enhance when eulogize
nor diminish when not eulogize
similarly su­bhūti this sacred doctrine be neither enhance when it be explain
nor be it diminish when it be not explain
even when it be explain it be just that and even when it be not explain it be just that
if one be to ask why venerable lord
this cultivation of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be like cultivate space and
the same go for the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection of generosity
in space the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not discern
nor be the other transcendent-perfection down to and include the transcendent-perfection of generosity discern
in space physical form be not discern nor be feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness discern
in space the emptiness of internal phenomenon be not discern
nor be the emptiness of external phenomenon the emptiness of both internal and external phenomenon and the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity discern
in space the application of mindfulness be not discern
nor be the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path discern
nor indeed be the ten power of the tathāgata and the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha discern
in space the fruit of enter the stream be not discern
nor be the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth discern
nor be the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth arhatship individual enlightenment and unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment discern
venerable lord i pay homage to those great-bodhisattva-being who would don this great armor
venerable lord those who would don this armor for the sake of sentient being actually seek to strive struggle and make effort for the sake of space
venerable lord those who seek to liberate sentient being from cyclic existence and who would don the great armor be actually seek to liberate space
venerable lord those who would don this armor for the sake of sentient being be actually seek to buttress the sky
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being who attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of sentient being acquire the great power of perseverance
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being who embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of all sentient being be heroic and courageous
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being who seek to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of sentient being who resemble space don the great armor and they don armor which be inconceivable and unequaled
if one be to ask why
venerable lord the depletion or replenishment of the world of sentient being would not be discernible
and if these tathāgata be to remain in the world and teach the sacred doctrine for an eon or more than an eon
and if each of these tathāgata be to establish innumerable countless immeasurable sentient being in final nirvāṇa
venerable lord if this world system of the great trichiliocosm be completely fill with tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha like a grove of reed a grove of bamboo a grove of sugar cane a paddy field or a grove of wild licorice
it be because sentient being be non existent and because sentient being be void
in the same vein as before
this apply extensively also to all the world system of the ten direction
venerable lord for these reason i state that those who would don the great armor and seek to attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for the sake of sentient being be actually seek to liberate space
then there be a certain monk present within the assembly who think
o venerable lord i pay homage to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in which although nothing at all arise or cease the aggregate of ethical discipline be still discern
the aggregate of meditative stability be still discern
the aggregate of wisdom be still discern
the aggregate of liberation be still discern
the aggregate of the perception of liberate pristine cognition be still discern
and similarly the fruit of enter the stream be still discern as indeed be the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth of no long be subject to rebirth of arhatship of individual enlightenment and of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
great-bodhisattva-being be still discern as indeed be the precious jewel of the buddha the precious jewel of the dharma and the precious jewel of the saṅgha
the turning of the wheel of the sacred doctrine be also still discern
then śakra mighty king of the god ask senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable su­bhūti when bodhisattva be equipoise in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
with respect to what be they equipoise in union
senior su­bhūti reply
the mind that would be equipoise in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be actually equipoise in union with space
śakra mighty king of the god then say to the blessed one
then senior su­bhūti address śakra mighty king of the god
venerable lord i will guard protect and offer sanctuary to those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who hold maintain recite aloud master and be attentive to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the right manner
kauśika can you conceive of anything which you would wish to guard and protect and toward which you would offer sanctuary
kauśika if those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage abide in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be describe
that itself will guard protect and offer sanctuary to they those human and non human adversary who wish to harm they will find no opportunity to do so
one should know that those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as it have be describe will never be separate from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
kauśika anyone think to guard protect and offer sanctuary to great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom would actually be think to guard protect and offer sanctuary to space
kauśika can you guard protect and offer sanctuary to a dream a mirage an optical aberration a magical display or a phantom
no venerable su­bhūti he reply
kauśika in the same way anyone think to guard protect and offer sanctuary to great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom would not succeed and would tire themselves out
kauśika do you think you can guard protect and offer sanctuary to the tathāgata or to an emanation of the tathāgata
kauśika in the same way anyone think to guard protect and offer sanctuary to great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom would not succeed and would simply tire themselves out
kauśika do you think you can guard protect and offer sanctuary to the expanse of reality the finality of existence the real nature and the inconceivable expanse
no venerable su­bhūti
kauśika in the same vein as before anyone wish to do so would not succeed and would simply tire themselves out
then śakra mighty king of the god ask senior su­bhūti as follow
venerable su­bhūti do you think that great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom discern provisionally that all thing be like a dream like a mirage like an echo like an illusion and like a phantom
then base on this understanding that they do not make assumption about their dream nor do they make assumption on account of their dream
senior su­bhūti then reply to śakra mighty king of the god
kauśika whenever great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
when they do not make assumption base on physical form and they do not make assumption on account of physical form
when they do not make assumption associate with physical form and do not make assumption about physical form
and similarly when they do not make assumption base on feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
when they do not make assumption on account of consciousness and the rest
when they do not make assumption associate with consciousness and the rest
do not make assumption about consciousness and the rest
and in the same vein as before
when they do not make assumption base on all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
when they do not make assumption on account of omniscience and so forth
when they do not make assumption associate with omniscience and so forth
and do not make assumption about omniscience and so forth]—in all those circumstance
great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do discern that phenomenon be like a dream and so forth and that they be like a phantom
then consequent on this understanding they do not make assumption base on dream
they do not make assumption on account of dream they do not make assumption associate with dream
and they do not make assumption about dream and so on
they do not make assumption base on phantom they do not make assumption on account of phantom
they do not make assumption associate with phantom and they do not make assumption about phantom
thereupon through the power of the buddha
the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm in this world system of the great trichiliocosm
along with the god of the trayas­triṃśa realm
the yāma tuṣita nirmāṇa­rata and para­nirmita­vaśa­vartin realm
all the god of the other realm up to and include the pure abodes scatter divine flower divine sandalwood powder and divine incense powder toward lord śākyamuni
those of the brahmapurohita and mahā­brahmā realm those of the parī­ttābha a­pramāṇābha and ābhāsvara realm
they then approach the place where lord śākyamuni be seat prostrate their head at the foot of the blessed one and take their place to one side
beheld in the eastern direction the form of the thousand buddha teach the sacred doctrine
then through the power of the buddha those god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm and those god of the other realm up to and include the pure abodes
while monk name su­bhūti exclusively request this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
and śakra mighty king of the god then exclusively request this specific chapter of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
similarly they beheld the thousand buddha in each of all the world system of the south west north nadir and zenith along with the four intermediate direction
the same refrain as for the eastern direction should be extensively apply to all these in every detail
then the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti once the great bodhisattva be maitreya have attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
he will teach this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in this very place
all the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha of this auspicious eon will indeed come to this very place and
teach this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord through what mode through what indication and through what sign
will the bodhisattva maitreya teach this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti the bodhisattva maitreya having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be permanent or that they be impermanent
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be imbue with happiness or that they be imbue with suffering
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be a self and that they be not a self
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be empty or that they be not empty
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be with sign or that they be signless
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form have aspiration or that they be without aspiration
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be calm or that they be not calm
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be void or that they be not void
he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be afflict or that they be purified
in the same manner he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that physical form be utterly pure or that they be not utterly pure
similarly he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be utterly pure or that they be not utterly pure
in the same vein he will not teach the sacred doctrine accord to the notion that all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be utterly pure or that they be not utterly pure
thereupon senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of physical form
similarly su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
similarly su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
venerable lord how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of physical form
similarly how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti physical form be absolutely pure because they neither arise nor cease and they be neither afflict nor purified
similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be absolutely pure because they neither arise nor cease and they be neither afflict nor purified
moreover su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of space
venerable lord how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom absolutely pure owe to the absolute purity of space
su­bhūti space be absolutely pure because it neither arise nor cease and it be neither afflict nor purified
moreover su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because physical form be unsullie
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be unsullie
venerable lord how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom absolutely pure owe to the unsullied nature of space
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because space can not be grasp
similarly the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because space can not be conventionally designate
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because just like the resonance of the echo of an echo in space su­bhūti space can not be conventionally designate
venerable lord how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom absolutely pure because space be not apprehend
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because space be not apprehend in any respect
moreover su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because all thing neither arise nor cease and be neither afflict nor purified
venerable lord how be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom absolutely pure because all thing neither arise nor cease and be neither afflict nor purify
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely pure because all thing be utterly pure
thereupon senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who hold maintain master recite aloud and be attentive to this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the right manner will venerable lord not suffer ailment of the eye
nor will they suffer ailment of the ear nor will they suffer ailment of the nose
nor will they suffer ailment of the tongue nor will their limb be defective
nor will their body become too decrepit and nor will they die a terrible death
that be to say the god of the catur­mahā­rāja­kāyika realm and those of the other realm up to and include the god of the pure abodes
along with many thousand of other god will deliberately follow they
on the eighth day the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day of the lunar month
the blessed one then address senior su­bhūti as follow
they will indeed generate many innumerable countless inconceivable and unappraisable merit
many host of the god will congregate in place where those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who teach the sacred doctrine preach and expound this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti it be so it be just as you have say
when those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage preach and expound this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom on the eighth day the fourteenth day and the fifteenth day of the lunar month
they will generate many innumerable countless inconceivable and unappraisable merit
when they preach and expound this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
an entourage of god will be in their presence
if you ask why su­bhūti
it be because this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be most precious
su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be precious in that it can liberate sentient being from the hell

thereupon those thousand of divine prince accept that phenomenon be non arising
then the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti owe to the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
this turning of the wheel of the sacred doctrine be not the first in jambu­dvīpa nor be it the second
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not at all establish as a doctrine that be to be set in motion or reverse
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord what be the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity owe to which this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not at all establish as a doctrine to be set in motion or reversed
the blessed one reply

this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which the bodhisattvas have be the great transcendent-perfection
for all thing be empty of the essential nature and indeed they be empty of all thing
dependent on this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom great-bodhisattva-being attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine even though nothing at all be set in motion or reverse
nothing at all be consider or promulgate by anyone at all
if one be to ask why
it be because in emptiness that which would set in motion or reverse anything at all be in no way apprehensible
it be because all thing be invariably unactualized
it be because emptiness do not set in motion or reverse anything at all
similarly
in the same vein
who do not turn away from unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment achieve that which be difficult
those who will not be dishearten but remain equipoised in this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without fear
venerable lord those great-bodhisattva-being who be neither dishearten nor intimidate when practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and cultivate the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in the same vein the refrain indicate in the precede part of this chapter should also be apply here
moreover venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in the extrasensory power
if one be to ask why it be because the extrasensory power be empty of the extrasensory power
the extrasensory power be not emptiness and emptiness be not the extrasensory power
however emptiness do not exist elsewhere apart from the extrasensory power nor do the extrasensory power exist elsewhere apart from emptiness
the nature of the extrasensory power be indeed emptiness and the nature of emptiness indeed be the extrasensory power
venerable lord for these reason great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in extrasensory power
moreover venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in the notion that physical form be impermanent
similarly they should not abide in the notion that feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be impermanent
if one be to ask why it be because the impermanence of physical form be empty of the impermanence of physical form
that which be the impermanence of physical form be not emptiness and that which be emptiness be not the impermanence of physical form
however emptiness do not exist elsewhere apart from the impermanence of physical form nor do the impermanence of physical form exist elsewhere apart from emptiness
the impermanence of physical form be indeed emptiness and emptiness indeed be the impermanence of physical form
similarly the same refrain also should be apply extensively in the case of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
venerable lord for these reason great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in the impermanence of physical form and so on up to and include the impermanence of consciousness
in the same vein they should not abide in the notion that the aggregate from physical form up to and include consciousness be imbue with happiness
nor should they abide in the notion that the aggregate from physical form up to and include consciousness be imbue with suffering
they should not abide in the notion that the aggregate from physical form up to and include consciousness be empty

nor should they abide in the notion that the aggregate from physical form up to and include consciousness be uncease
nor should they abide in the notion that the aggregate from physical form up to and include consciousness be not entity
if one be to ask why it be exactly as state above in the context of the aggregate of physical form
moreover venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in the real nature of phenomenon
if one be to ask why it be because the real nature of phenomenon be empty of the real nature of phenomenon
emptiness do not exist elsewhere apart from the real nature of phenomenon nor do the real nature of phenomenon exist elsewhere apart from emptiness
the real nature of phenomenon be indeed emptiness and emptiness indeed be the real nature of phenomenon
venerable lord for these reason great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in the real nature of phenomenon
in the same vein they should not abide in actual reality the expanse of reality the maturity of all thing and the finality of existence
if one be to ask why it be exactly as state above
moreover venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom should not abide in all the gateway of mnemonic incantation or in all the gateway of meditative stability
if one be to ask why it be because the gateway of mnemonic incantation and the gateway of meditative stability be empty of the gateway of mnemonic incantation and the gateway of meditative stability
the same refrain should be extensively apply here as before
venerable lord when unskille bodhisattvas who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom engage with physical form while their mental faculty resort to notion of i and mine and
when they engage with feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness in a similar manner they engage in the conditioning of physical form
they engage in the conditioning of feeling in the conditioning of perception in the conditioning of formative predisposition and in the conditioning of consciousness
ngage in such conditioning they can not grasp the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they do not engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
without perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they will not attain emancipation in omniscience
venerable lord when bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom if owe to their lack of skill in mean they engage with physical form while their mental faculty resort to notion of i and mine and
if they engage with feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness in a similar manner they will engage in the conditioning of physical form
and similarly they will engage in the conditioning of feeling they will engage in the conditioning of perception they will engage in the conditioning of formative predisposition and they will engage in the conditioning of consciousness
engage in such conditioning they can not grasp the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and they can not engage in union with the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord when unskille bodhisattvas practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom while their mental faculty resort to notion of i and mine and so on
and if they engage in the gateway of mnemonic incantation and the gateway of meditative stability they will engage in the conditioning of the gateway of mnemonic incantation and the gateway of meditative stability
if one be to ask why it be because physical form can not be appropriate
and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness can not be appropriate
the non appropriation of physical form be not physical form on account of the emptiness of its inherent existence
without perfect the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they will not attain emancipation in omniscience
similarly the non appropriation of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be not consciousness and the other aggregate on account of the emptiness of their inherent existence
in the same vein the gateway of mnemonic incantation and the gateway of meditative stability can not be appropriate
on account of the emptiness of their inherent existence the non appropriation of the gateway of mnemonic incantation or the gateway of meditative stability be not the gateway of mnemonic incantation or the gateway of meditative stability
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom also can not be appropriate on account of the emptiness of its inherent existence
great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner
should determine that all thing be empty of inherent existence
they should determine that there be no mental wandering whatsoever with respect to anything
this be the spacious immeasurable and indefinable method of great-bodhisattva-being know as the maṇḍala of the meditative stability of non appropriation which be not share in common with all the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha
omniscience also can not be appropriate on account of the emptiness of internal phenomenon on account of the emptiness of external phenomenon and similarly on account of the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon
in proximity to this book they should not negligently engage in careless action
the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage should also perfume that locale with various kind of incense as an offering to this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they should arrange various flower
they should scent it with aromatic jar

they should excellently adorn that locale in many way
moreover ānanda the body of those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who venerate and make offering to this book of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom will never tire
they will be comfortable in body comfortable in mind endow with lightness of body and
majesty of body and their mind will be radiant
perceive the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in that manner when asleep they will have no inauspicious dream
for they will behold in their dream the body of the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha excellently adorn with the thirty two major mark of a superior man
radiant with the eighty minor mark
and teach the sacred doctrine his golden body surround by and in the presence of the community of fully ordain monk
they will also hear the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha impart the sacred doctrine from the six transcendent-perfection and the four application of mindfulness up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they will hear the analysis of the meaning of these transcendent-perfection
similarly they will hear the analysis of the meaning of the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
they will also behold the tree of enlightenment
they will see the bodhisattva next to the tree of enlightenment
and they will see he attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
similarly they will see he having attain manifestly perfect buddhahood turn the wheel of the sacred doctrine
and they will also know and behold many hundred of thousand of bodhisattva establish in their discussion how omniscience should be attain
how sentient being should be bring to maturity
how the buddhafield should be refine
and how demonic force along with their entourage should be discipline
they will hear the voice of many hundred billion trillion of buddha from the eastern direction
similarly they will hear the voice of many hundred billion trillion of buddha from the southern western northern and intermediate direction
similarly they will behold in the eastern direction many hundred billion trillion of buddha who be pass into final nirvāṇa
they will hear they say o in such and such a world system
the tathā­gata arhat genuinely perfect buddha so and so teach the sacred doctrine surround by and in the presence of so many thousand of bodhisattvas and so many hundred billion trillion of śrāvakas
they will behold trillion of stūpa fashion of the seven kind of precious metal and gem contain the relic of those who have pass into final nirvāṇa
they will see themselves honor venerating and make offering to those tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and to the stūpas of those tathāgata with flower garland incense unguent powder religious robe clothing parasol victory banner ribbon and diverse musical sound
similarly in the other direction up to and include the zenith
in the same vein those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage will have auspicious dream of this type
and they will awaken entirely at ease
their sustenance will be provide
they will experience lightness of body
they will not be attach to food
they will be without attachment to their religious robe
if you ask why
in the same vein they will have few idea about everyday necessity
just as a monk who have engage in meditative union lack strong attachment to food on arise from his meditative stability
in the same way they will have few idea about food
they will have few idea about food
ānanda they will become like that when their physical sustenance be provide by non human being in certain way
in the same way
the tathāgata bodhisattvas god nāgas yakṣas gandharvas antigod garuḍas kiṃnara and mahoraga present in the world system of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges will sustain their body
as long as they live
this complete the seventeenth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle advantages
these non human being will honor venerate respect and make offering to they with ribbon and so forth along with various musical sound
then senior śāradvatī­putra ask the blessed one
venerable lord
where do those great-bodhisattva-being who aspire to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom pass away before come into this world
for how long have they embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
how many tathāgata have they honor
how long have they practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity and similarly how long have they practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
do they genuinely and methodically aspire to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the blessed one reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
śāradvatī­putra those great-bodhisattva-being have come into this world having honor innumerable countless and limitless tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
they have subsequently be reborn and be now present in this world
śāradvatī­putra those great-bodhisattva-being have embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment for immeasurable countless and limitless hundred billion trillion eon
from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment onwards
they have practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity and then come here
in the same way they have practice the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and then come here
śāradvatī­putra from that time onwards they have honor countless limitless tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha and then come here into this world
śāradvatī­putra when those great-bodhisattva-being see or hear the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they will think i have see the teacher
śāradvatī­putra those great-bodhisattva-being will realize this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in a signless non dual and non focussing manner genuinely and methodically
thereupon senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom then disclose to listener and viewer
the blessed one reply
it be not su­bhūti
if you ask why su­bhūti the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have no listener or viewer

su­bhūti even enlightenment and the buddha be neither hear nor see owe to the nature of phenomenon be inanimate
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be profound and it be hard to aspire to it
su­bhūti it be so
it be just as you have speak
su­bhūti this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be profound
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because physical form be neither fetter nor liberated

omniscience be all neither fetter nor liberated
su­bhūti it be because the natural expression of omniscience and the other attribute and attainment though without entity be still omniscience and the rest
moreover su­bhūti the past limit of physical form be neither fetter nor liberated
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because the natural expression of the four application of mindfulness though without entity be still the four application of mindfulness

if you ask why
in the same vein su­bhūti
in the same vein

the blessed one reply
it be so su­bhūti
su­bhūti the purity of physical form be identical to the purity of the fruit
similarly the purity of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be identical to it
the purity of all other attribute up to and include enlightenment
be identical to the purity of the fruit
moreover su­bhūti the purity of physical form be the purity of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom

if you ask why
venerable lord
it be just as you have say
su­bhūti it be difficult for those who do not persevere and so on and who practice without alertness to aspire toward this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in the same vein
this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it be difficult to aspire toward
for those who do not persevere
who have not plant the root of virtuous action
who have fall into the clutch of evil associate
who be under the sway of demonic force and
who be indolent
feeble in perseverance
forgetful and
who practice without alertness
so it be that the purity of physical form and
then the blessed one address senior su­bhūti
why su­bhūti do great-bodhisattva-being not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being do not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom owe to the non existence of all thing
similarly great-bodhisattva-being do not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom owe to the fact that all thing be void and calm
for this reason venerable lord great-bodhisattva-being do not become discouraged with regard to this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
if one be to ask why
venerable lord it be because all thing be non apprehensible in term of those who would be discourage the agent of their discouragement or the object of their discouragement
venerable lord if when this be explain
great-bodhisattva-being do not grow idle and be not discourage not terrified not fearful not afraid and will not be afraid then they really do practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it be because all thing be non apprehensible in term of those who would be discourage the agent of their discouragement or the object of their discouragement
the god head by indra those head by brahmā and the god head by prajā­pati always pay homage to great-bodhisattva-being who practice accordingly
the blessed one then reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be not only the ephemeral god head by indra the god head by brahmā and the god head by prajā­pati who always pay homage to those great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but
also the manifestly sublime god namely the god of the śubha­kṛtsna realm those of the bṛhat­phala realm and those of the pure abodes will always pay homage to those great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who reside and be present teach the sacred doctrine in the innumerable countless immeasurable world system of the ten direction will always turn their enlightened intention toward those great-bodhisattva-being so that these great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom might completely perfect the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
and similarly so that they might completely perfect the other transcendent-perfection down to and include the transcendent-perfection of generosity and then completely perfect all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and those great-bodhisattva-being to whom the lord buddha direct their enlightened intention should be accept so that they progress to buddhahood
su­bhūti if all the sentient being as many as there be in world system as numerous as the sand of the river ganges be to transform into malign demonic force and
if each of these demonic force be also to emanate again just as many malign and demonic force
they would all be powerless to obstruct the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment of great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
again su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being be endow with two attribute they will not be subdue by any of those demonic force
if you ask what these two entail
they be to regard all thing as emptiness and not to abandon any sentient being
moreover su­bhūti when great-bodhisattva-being be endow with two other attribute
they will not be subdue by all those demonic force
if you ask what constitute these two
it entail that they should do exactly what they say they will do and that they should be keep in mind by the lord buddhas
those god will think to approach great-bodhisattva-being who practice accordingly and
having approach they will venerate they
and ask question and counter question
o child of enlighten heritage you should dwell in accordance with the abide state of emptiness the abide state of signlessness and the abide state of aspirationlessness
o child of enlighten heritage you should swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if you ask why
o child of enlighten heritage it be because when you dwell in accordance with these abide state you will become a sanctuary for those without sanctuary an island for those without an island and a light for sentient being who be shroud in darkness
enthusiastically say
o child of enlighten heritage it be because the lord buddhas who reside and be present teach the sacred doctrine in the innumerable countless and immeasurable world system of the ten direction surround by their monastic community of fully ordain monk will proclaim the name and clan of these great-bodhisattva-being while teach the sacred doctrine and utter their aphorism
for example su­bhūti
i right now proclaim the name and the clan of the great bodhisattva be ratna­ketu while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism
similarly i proclaim the name and the clan of the great bodhisattva be śikhin while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism and
i proclaim the name and the clan of those great-bodhisattva-being who practice chastity dependent on this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in the buddhafield of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha a­kṣobhya while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism
su­bhūti the lord buddhas who reside and be present teach the sacred doctrine in the world system of the eastern direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges will while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism proclaim the name and clan of those great-bodhisattva-being in this buddhafield who practice chastity commence from this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in the same vein
the lord buddhas who reside and be present teach the sacred doctrine in the world system of the southern direction the western direction the northern direction the intermediate direction the nadir and the zenith numerous as the sand of the river ganges will while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism proclaim the name and clan of those great-bodhisattva-being in those respective buddhafield who practice chastity commence from this very transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the lord buddha who reside in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because great-bodhisattva-being for whom such action be difficult will ensure that the lineage of the buddha will not be interrupt
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism do the lord buddhas proclaim the name and clan of those bodhisattva who may provisionally regress or those of great-bodhisattva-being who will not regress
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti indeed there be irreversible great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
they be indeed irreversible
su­bhūti there be also foreordain great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the lord buddhas will proclaim their name and clan while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism
venerable lord who be they
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti there be great-bodhisattva-being who reside in the buddhafield of the tathāgata a­kṣobhya and who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in accordance with the training of that tathāgata
moreover su­bhūti there be great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and who be absolutely intent on this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but
those who be intent on the emptiness of all thing but have not accept that phenomenon be non arising and
those who be intent on the voidness hollowness vacuity and essencelessness of all thing but have not accept that phenomenon be non arising
moreover su­bhūti there be great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and who be absolutely intent on this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but who have not accept that phenomenon be non arise
su­bhūti the lord buddhas will proclaim the name and clan of all those great-bodhisattva-being while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism
su­bhūti there be also those great-bodhisattva-being who having transcend the level of the śrāvaka and the pratyekabuddha be certain to attain unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
su­bhūti the lord buddhas while teach the sacred doctrine and uttering aphorism will proclaim the name and clan of all those great-bodhisattva-being for they will abide on the irreversible level and abide thereon they will attain omniscience
moreover su­bhūti when this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be explain if those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas after study its meaning
become free from doubt free from hesitation and free from delusion and
heir mind accept that this exactly accord with the teaching give by the tathāgata
they will have the confidence that come from study the sacred doctrine and
they will gradually study this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom more extensively in the presence of the tathāgata a­kṣobhya and those great-bodhisattva-being
having study it they will indeed come to abide on the irreversible level and
abide thereon they will also attain omniscience
su­bhūti since those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who follow the vehicle of the bodhisattvas will be revere even upon hear this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
how much more so will be those who recite it aloud keep it and attain the real nature
those bodhisattva will swiftly abide on the irreversible level
swiftly and exclusively they will then attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
venerable lord since when they abide in the real nature they do not apprehend anything at all and there be nothing that exist
how then will great-bodhisattva-being abide therein swiftly be establish on the irreversible level and swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
venerable lord when apart from the real nature they do not apprehend anything at all
who will abide in this real nature
who will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
then teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
venerable lord when the real nature be itself non apprehensible
who will abide in the real nature and then attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment let alone abide exclusively in the real nature and teach the sacred doctrine
who will abide in the real nature and
that would be impossible
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
who abide in the real nature will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
when the real nature be itself non apprehensible
that be so su­bhūti
it be as you have say
su­bhūti there be nothing at all that would apart from the real nature abide in the real nature that would abide in the real nature attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and that would abide in the real nature teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
if you ask why
su­bhūti the real nature neither arise nor cease and its modification be non apprehensible
su­bhūti who would abide in that which neither arise nor cease and where modification be non apprehensible
who abide therein would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
who abide therein would teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
that would be impossible
thereupon śakra mighty lord of the god say to the blessed one
venerable lord this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be profound
great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom achieve that which be difficult
if one be to ask why
venerable lord it be because there be nothing term the real nature which they would apprehend
there be nothing that would abide in the real nature nor be there anything that would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
nor be there anything that would teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being
venerable lord when great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
even though they investigate and meditate accordingly they will not be discourage thereby
they will not succumb to doubt and they will not be delude
then senior su­bhūti address śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika you have say that great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and who do not succumb to doubt and be undelude with regard to those thing even though they investigate these thing achieve that which be difficult
kauśika since all thing be empty who be there who would succumb to doubt and be delude
śakra mighty lord of the god reply to senior su­bhūti
venerable su­bhūti whatever doctrine you be teach you teach all of they commence exclusively from emptiness and you be unimpeded in all respect
just as an arrow shot into the air be not impede anywhere
so be the venerable su­bhūti unimpede with respect to the sacred doctrine
this complete the twenty sixth chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle rejoicing
if one be to ask why
it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non conceptual
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti be it only the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be non conceptual or be the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and in the same vein all the other transcendent-perfection down to and include the transcendent-perfection of generosity non conceptual
senior śāradvatī­putra the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration and in the same vein all the other transcendent-perfection down to and include the transcendent-perfection of generosity be also non conceptual
senior su­bhūti be the sense field from the sense field of sight to the sense field of the mental faculty also non conceptual
similarly be the aspect of consciousness from visual consciousness to mental consciousness also non conceptual
similarly be feeling from those condition by sensory contact that be visually compound to those condition by sensory contact that be mentally compound also non conceptual
senior su­bhūti be the meditative concentration also non conceptual
similarly be the immeasurable aspiration and the formless absorption also non conceptual
be the application of mindfulness also non conceptual
be the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path also non conceptual
be the three gateway to liberation also non conceptual
similarly be the ten power of the tathāgata the four assurance the four unhindered discernment great loving kindness great compassion and the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha also non conceptual
senior su­bhūti be enlightenment also non conceptual
senior su­bhūti be the unconditioned element also non conceptual
senior śāradvatī­putra to be brief all thing be non conceptual
senior su­bhūti if all thing be non conceptual
how have this differentiation come about with regard to the cycle of existence with its five realm of live being namely the denizen of the hell the animal domain the world of anguished spirit the world of the god and the world of humankind
how have this distinction come about between those who have enter the stream those who be tie to one more rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth those who be arhat those who be pratyekabuddha and those who be tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
thereupon senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra those sentient being who actualize the impact of past action through body speech and mind motivate by erroneous view have experience the ripening of past action correspond to the root of their particular volition this cause the materialization of the sense field of sight which the denizen of the hell the animal domain the world of yama the god and human possess
senior śāradvatī­putra when you ask how these distinction have come about between those who have enter the stream and so on up to and include those who be tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
senior śāradvatī­putra those who have enter the stream be non conceptual and
the fruit of having enter the stream be also non conceptual
similarly those who be tie to one more rebirth the fruit of be tie to one more rebirth those who be no long subject to rebirth the fruit of no long be subject to rebirth those who be arhat arhatship those who be pratyekabuddha individual enlightenment
and also the genuinely perfect buddha be all non conceptual
senior śāradvatī­putra those tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who appear in the past be also non conceptual and
they will have abandon all thought and concept
those tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who will appear in the future will also be non conceptual and
those tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha who be alive and reside teach the sacred doctrine at the present time in the world system of the ten direction numerous as the sand of the river ganges be also non conceptual and they have abandon all thought and concept
for this reason senior śāradvatī­putra
one should know that once the real nature without conceptual notion have be appraise and similarly once the finality of existence without concept and the expanse of reality without concept have be appraise all thing be without concept
senior śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being should practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in a non conceptual manner
when they practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom without concept
they will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood with respect to all thing that be without concept
then senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti do great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom practice the essential doctrine
or else be they practice the essenceless doctrine
senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom practice the essenceless doctrine
if you ask why
senior śāradvatī­putra it be because this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be essenceless
similarly the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity be all essenceless
similarly all the other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience be essenceless
if you ask why
senior śāradvatī­putra it be because when great-bodhisattva-being who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom do not even apprehend or consider essencelessness
how could they possibly apprehend or consider an essence
since they neither apprehend nor consider the essenceless transcendental perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
they neither apprehend nor consider the other essenceless attribute and attainment up to and include the essenceless omniscience
how then could they possibly apprehend or consider the essence of those attribute from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom to omniscience
then the multitude of divine prince inhabit the world system of desire think
those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who cultivate unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom just as it have be explain and who despite practice with that goal do not remain on the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha because they do not actualize the finality of existence associate with those level be all worthy of homage
for this reason too great-bodhisattva-being who do not realize the uniformity of all thing be worthy of homage
then senior su­bhūti reply to those divine prince as follow
o divine prince the astonishing singular difficulty for those bodhisattva be not that they do not realize the uniformity of all virtuous attribute by realize which they would remain on the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha but
divine prince their utmost difficulty be that they don the armor that resolve to establish innumerable countless and immeasurable hundred of thousand of sentient being in final nirvāṇa while those sentient being whom they would lead to final nirvāṇa be utterly non apprehensible
those great-bodhisattva-being who think they should seek to train all sentient being and then
having really set out for unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
don their armor resolve to train all sentient being might as well think they should seek to train space
if you ask why
sentient being should be regard as voidness because space itself be void
similarly sentient being should be regard as emptiness because space itself be emptiness and
sentient being should be regard as essencelessness because space itself be essenceless
for this reason divine prince it be difficult for great-bodhisattva-being who don the armor of great compassion for the sake of sentient being who do not exist
those who for the sake of sentient being think they should don the armor of great compassion might as well think they should seek to do battle with space
the armor which great-bodhisattva-being don and the sentient being for whose sake they actually don their armor be both non apprehensible
the armor should be regard as void because sentient being be void
if when this be explain great-bodhisattva-being be not discourage and not utterly dishearten
they do practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it be because the physical form that be void constitute the nature of sentient being who be also void
similarly the feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness that be void constitute the nature of sentient being who be also void
similarly the physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness that be void constitute the nature of the six transcendent-perfection that be also void and so on
in the same vein as before up to and include omniscience
if when it be teach that all thing be void great-bodhisattva-being be not discourage not terrified not fearful not afraid and will not be afraid
venerable lord why be the purity of omniscience due to the purity of the self
the blessed one reply
this be because of selflessness because of the absence of define characteristic and because of the absence of any knower
venerable lord there be neither attainment nor emergent realization due to the purity of duality
su­bhūti there be neither attainment nor clear realization due to absolute purity
venerable lord why be there neither attainment nor clear realization due to the purity of duality
it be so because duality arise erroneously
venerable lord the limitlessness of physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be due to the limitlessness of self
this be because the self be absolutely pure
venerable lord why be the limitlessness of physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness due to the limitlessness of self
it be so because of the absence of self and because of the emptiness of the unlimited and the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end
it be the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom of great-bodhisattva-being through which this be realize
su­bhūti this be because all thing be absolutely pure
venerable lord why be it the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom of great-bodhisattva-being through which this be realize
it be so because of the understanding of the aspect of the path
venerable lord if these great-bodhisattva-being skilled in mean who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom think that they do not cognize physical form as physical form
that they do not cognize feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness as consciousness and the rest
that they do not cognize past phenomenon as past phenomenon
that they do not cognize future phenomenon as future phenomenon
that they do not cognize present phenomenon as present phenomenon
that they do not cognize the transcendent-perfection of generosity as the transcendent-perfection of generosity
that they do not cognize the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom as the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and the rest
and in the same vein
that they do not cognize all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience as omniscience and the rest
then those bodhisattva will abide in genuine reality the definitive aggregate which comprise unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti it be so
it be just as you have say
thereupon senior śāradvatī­putra address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti do great-bodhisattva-being skilled in mean who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have dualistic perception
senior su­bhūti reply to senior śāradvatī­putra as follow
senior śāradvatī­putra with regard to great-bodhisattva-being skilled in mean who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
it be on account of the emptiness of internal phenomenon the emptiness of external phenomenon and similarly on account of the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon the emptiness of emptiness the emptiness of great extent the emptiness of ultimate reality the emptiness of condition phenomenon the emptiness of unconditioned phenomenon the emptiness of the unlimited the emptiness of that which have neither beginning nor end the emptiness of non dispersal the emptiness of inherent existence the emptiness of all thing and the emptiness of intrinsic define characteristic
i should give a gift
i should give a gift to that person
i should give this sort of gift
i should maintain ethical discipline
i should maintain ethical discipline in this manner
i should cultivate tolerance
i should cultivate tolerance in this manner
i should try to persevere

i should refine the buddhafield in this manner
i should bring sentient being to maturity
i should bring sentient being to maturity in this manner
i should attain omniscience
i should attain omniscience in this manner
o senior śāradvatī­putra that these great-bodhisattva-being skilled in mean who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be without all conceptual notion such as
senior śāradvatī­putra this be indicative of the non attachment of great-bodhisattva-being skilled in mean who practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
thereupon śakra mighty lord of the god address senior su­bhūti as follow
senior su­bhūti how should one recognize the attachment of those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who belong to the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
senior su­bhūti reply to śakra mighty lord of the god
kauśika when those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who belong to the vehicle of the bodhisattvas perceive their own mind perceive generosity perceive the transcendent-perfection of generosity perceive ethical discipline perceive the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline perceive tolerance perceive the transcendent-perfection of tolerance perceive perseverance perceive the transcendent-perfection of perseverance perceive meditative concentration perceive the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration perceive wisdom perceive the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and similarly when they perceive the emptiness of internal phenomenon when they perceive the emptiness of external phenomenon and the emptiness of both external and internal phenomenon and in the same vein when they perceive the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of essential nature with respect to non entity when they perceive the four application of mindfulness perceive the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path perceive the ten power of the tathāgata perceive the other fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha perceive buddhahood perceive the root of virtue that give rise to buddhahood and on assess and synthesise all these phenomenon dedicate they to unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being while perceive that they be make this dedication
kauśika all these should be recognize as indicative of the attachment of the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who belong to the vehicle of the bodhisattvas
when they be involve with those mode of attachment they can not practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom which be without attachment
if you ask why
kauśika they be incapable of dedicate the nature of physical form and
they be incapable of dedicate the nature of feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness
in the same vein as before
they be incapable of dedicate the nature of all those other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience
moreover kauśika great-bodhisattva-being should delight other
moreover kauśika great-bodhisattva-being should delight other they should discern the sameness of all thing and empathize with all situation that arise in all way they should cause other to rejoice in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they should encourage they fill they with enthusiasm and instruct they
when practice the transcendent-perfection of generosity and so forth
i be give a gift
i be maintain ethical discipline
i be cultivate tolerance
i be try to persevere
i be absorb in meditative concentration
i be cultivate wisdom
i be practice the emptiness of internal phenomenon
i be practice the emptiness of external phenomenon
i be cultivate the application of mindfulness
and in the same vein
i be cultivate all other attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
i be engage in the practice of perfect enlightenment
they should not be attentive to conceptual notion base on mental image
rather the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who do so should cause other to rejoice in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
when through rejoicing encouragement inspiration and instruction they cause other to rejoice encourage they fill they with enthusiasm and instruct they
they themselves will not degenerate in their commitment and
this will encourage the buddha to praise and accept they
the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who act in that manner will renounce all the limit of attachment
thereupon the blessed one address senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti you have speak well concern the purification of the limit of attachment possess by great-bodhisattva-being and also concern great-bodhisattva-being who purify the limit of attachment
su­bhūti for this reason i will also explain other more subtle limit of attachment so listen well and be attentive
venerable lord may it be so
senior su­bhūti reply and listen to the blessed one who say
su­bhūti when some son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage who have embark on unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be attentive to mental image of the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
su­bhūti inasmuch as they be attentive to mental image to that extent there be attachment
moreover su­bhūti when these son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage be attentive to mental image of all the root of virtue possess by past present and future tathāgata from the time when they first begin to set their mind on enlightenment until they establish the sacred doctrine and having be attentive in term of mental image dedicate they to the unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being
inasmuch as they be attentive to mental image su­bhūti to that extent there be attachment
similarly su­bhūti when they be attentive to mental image of the root of virtue possess by the śrāvakas of those tathāgata and to all the root of virtue possess by other sentient being and dedicate they to unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment make common cause with all sentient being
inasmuch as they be attentive to mental image of sentient being and so forth they do not actually dedicate these root of virtue to their unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and
to that extent there be attachment
if you ask why
su­bhūti it be because they should not be attentive to mental image even of the root of virtue possess by the tathāgata and the community of śrāvakas of the tathāgata
then senior su­bhūti say to the blessed one
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be profound
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti this be because all phenomenon be naturally void
venerable lord i pay homage to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
su­bhūti since it be unfabricated and unconditioned there be no one at all who can attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
venerable lord there be nothing at all that attain manifestly perfect buddhahood
su­bhūti so it be that the nature of phenomenon be without duality
su­bhūti the nature of phenomenon be entirely singular
su­bhūti this singular nature of phenomenon be without inherent existence
su­bhūti this nature be the genuine nature
this genuine nature be unconditioned
su­bhūti so it be that when great-bodhisattva-being know that the lack of inherent existence with respect to all phenomenon be unconditioned
they abandon all the limit of attachment
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be hard to realize
su­bhūti this be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have not be see hear or cognize by anyone at all
venerable lord the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be inconceivable
su­bhūti this be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom have not be produce by mind
the purity of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be indivisible
they can not be separate they can not be differentiate and they can not be sever
in the same vein
the purity of physical form be the purity of all other attribute up to and include omniscience
the purity of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be the purity of physical form
and this purity of omniscience be indivisible
moreover su­bhūti the purity of non duality
and the purity of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be indivisible
moreover su­bhūti physical form be pure and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be pure owe to the purity of sentient being living organism living creature and so forth up to knower and viewer
omniscience be pure owe to the purity of knower viewer and so forth
so it be that the purity of knower and viewer
moreover su­bhūti physical form be pure and similarly feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness be pure owe to the purity of desire hatred and delusion
all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure
so it be that the purity of desire hatred and delusion
the purity of physical form feeling perception formative predisposition and consciousness and
the purity of all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be indivisible
moreover su­bhūti formative predisposition be pure owe to the purity of fundamental ignorance
consciousness be pure owe to the purity of formative predisposition
name and form be pure owe to the purity of consciousness
the six sense field be pure owe to the purity of name and form
sensory contact be pure owe to the purity of the six sense field
sensation be pure owe to the purity of sensory contact
craving be pure owe to the purity of sensation
grasp be pure owe to the purity of craving
the rebirth process be pure owe to the purity of grasping
birth be pure owe to the purity of the rebirth process
aging and death along with sorrow lamentation suffering discomfort and agitation be pure owe to the purity of birth
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be pure owe to the purity of aging and death along with sorrow lamentation suffering discomfort and agitation
the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
the transcendent-perfection of perseverance be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
the transcendent-perfection of tolerance be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
the transcendent-perfection of generosity be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
the emptiness of internal phenomenon and in the same vein the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
the application of mindfulness be pure owe to the purity of the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity and the rest
all other attribute up to and include the understanding of all phenomenon be pure owe to the purity of the application of mindfulness and so forth
the understanding of the aspect of the path be pure owe to the purity of the understanding of all phenomenon
omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the understanding of the aspect of the path
so it be that the understanding of all phenomenon
the understanding of the aspect of the path and
omniscience be indivisible
they can not be separate they can not be differentiate and they can not be sever
moreover su­bhūti physical form be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
in the same vein
all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
so it be that the purity of the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
the purity of all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be indivisible
in the same vein as before
physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
similarly physical form be pure and all other attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
similarly physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of tolerance
physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
similarly physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the transcendent-perfection of generosity
moreover su­bhūti physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the emptiness of internal phenomenon
physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the other aspect of emptiness up to and include the emptiness of the essential nature of non entity
similarly physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the application of mindfulness
in the same vein
physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the other causal attribute up to and include the noble eightfold path
in the same vein as before
physical form be pure and all other phenomenon attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be pure owe to the purity of the fruitional attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
so it be that the purity of all these attribute up to and include the eighteen distinct quality of the buddha
and the purity of physical form and the purity of omniscience be indivisible
they can not be separate they can not be differentiate and they can not be sever
moreover su­bhūti unconditioned phenomenon be pure owe to the purity of condition phenomenon
the same refrain may also be apply in the case of each of the aforementione term from physical form to omniscience
in other word when present more extensively the same refrain may also be extrapolate from each of those term and append consecutively
condition phenomenon be pure owe to the purity of unconditioned phenomenon
so it be that the purity of condition phenomenon and the purity of unconditioned phenomenon be indivisible
moreover su­bhūti the future and the present be pure owe to the purity of the past
the past and the present be pure owe to the purity of the future
the past and the future be pure owe to the purity of the present
so it be that the purity of the past the purity of the future and the purity of the present be indivisible

su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
teach the sacred doctrine to sentient being with unrelenting perseverance
they teach the sacred doctrine in all way establish those sentient being in the transcendent-perfection of generosity and
likewise establish they in the other transcendent-perfection up to and include the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom but
in do so they do not at all establish they in condition element and they do not at all establish they in unconditioned element
in this way su­bhūti do great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom acquire the transcendent-perfection of perseverance
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being after abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom acquire the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
the blessed one reply
may become equipoise in the meditative stability of the śrāvaka or the meditative stability of the pratyekabuddha or in the meditative stability of the bodhisattva in all of they except the meditative stability of the tathāgata
abide in those meditative stability of the bodhisattvas and so forth
they may become equipoise in and arise from the eight aspect of liberation either sequentially or in reverse order
if you ask what these eight be
they be as follow
the first aspect of liberation ensue when corporeal being observe physical form
the second aspect of liberation ensue when formless being endow with internal perception observe external physical form
the third aspect of liberation ensue when being be incline toward pleasant state
the fourth aspect of liberation ensue when the perception of physical form have be completely transcend in all respect when the perception of obstruct phenomenon have subside and the mind do not engage with diverse perception so that one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite space think space be infinite
the fifth aspect of liberation ensue when the sense field of infinite space have be completely transcend in all respect and when one achieve and abide in the sense field of infinite consciousness think consciousness be infinite
the sixth aspect of liberation ensue when the sense field of infinite consciousness have be completely transcend in all respect and one achieve and abide in the sense field of nothing at all think there be nothing at all
the seventh aspect of liberation ensue when the sense field of nothing at all have be completely transcend in all respect and one achieve and abide in the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
the eighth aspect of liberation ensue when the sense field of neither perception nor non perception have be completely transcend in all respect and one achieve and abide in the cessation of all perception and feeling
they may become equipoise in and arise from these eight aspect of liberation both sequentially and in the reverse order
similarly they may become equipoise in and arise from the nine serial step of meditative equipoise either sequentially or in reverse order
if you ask what these nine be
they comprise
the four meditative concentration the four formless absorption and the cessation of all perception and feeling
after differentiate these eight aspect of liberation and the nine serial step of meditative equipoise
they may become absorb in the meditative stability know as the yawn lion
su­bhūti if you ask what be the meditative stability know as the yawn lion which great-bodhisattva-being may experience at this point
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being will have achieve and maintain the first meditative concentration where there be freedom from desire and freedom from negative and non virtuous attribute while ideation and scrutiny be present alongside the joy and bliss that arise from that freedom
similarly they will have achieve and maintain all the other meditative concentration up to and include the fourth meditative concentration where both bliss and suffering have be abandon and neither suffering nor bliss be present because blissful and unhappy state of mind have both previously subside while equanimity and mindfulness be utterly pure
similarly they will have become equipoise in the formless absorption up to and include the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
then they will have become equipoise in the cessation of perception and feeling
arise from that meditative stability which be the equipoise in cessation
then in reverse order they become equipoise in the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
arise from that equipoise in the sense field of neither perception nor non perception
in the same vein
they abide equipoise in the other formless absorption and meditative concentration down to and include the first meditative concentration
su­bhūti this be the meditative stability know as the yawn lion
abide in that meditative stability
they attain the sameness of all thing
in this way su­bhūti do great-bodhisattva-being abide in the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
acquire the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration
this complete the twenty seventh chapter from the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom in ten thousand lines entitle full attainment
senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being after abide in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance acquire the transcendent-perfection of generosity
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being after abide in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance acquire the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline
venerable lord how do great-bodhisattva-being after abide in the transcendent-perfection of tolerance acquire the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
kauśika you may be able to measure with a tip of a hair split one hundredfold all the drop of water in the ocean of this world system of the great trichiliocosm but you can not measure the merit of those who have set their mind on enlightenment derive from the rejoicing of those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage
then śakra mighty lord of the god say to the blessed one
venerable lord those who would not rejoice in sentient being who set their mind on enlightenment be inspire by demonic force
venerable lord those who would not rejoice in sentient being who set their mind on enlightenment be on the side of demonic force
venerable lord those who would not rejoice in sentient being who set their mind on enlightenment have be reborn here after die in the domain of demonic force
if one be to ask why
it be because those who have successfully set their mind on enlightenment and dedicate the merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment actually shatter the domain of demonic force
one should rejoice in those who have set their mind on the aspiration toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
those who do not forsake the buddha who do not forsake the dharma and who do not forsake the saṅgha should rejoice in those who have set their mind on enlightenment then
having rejoice in they set their mind on enlightenment
they should dedicate the merit to unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment without engage in the notion that the setting of the mind on enlightenment be singular or the notion that it be dual or the notion that it be plural
the blessed one reply
kauśika it be so
it be just as you have say
those who rejoice in these bodhisattvas who set their mind on enlightenment will swiftly attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
even those who engage in the conduct of a bodhisattva will swiftly please the tathāgata arhat genuinely perfect buddha
they will never again perceive unpleasant sight
they will never hear unpleasant sound
they will never smell unpleasant odor
they will never savor unpleasant taste
they will never touch unpleasant tangible object
they will never be conscious of unpleasant mental phenomenon
they will never lack the sight of the buddha
they will move from buddhafield to buddhafield and
they will venerate the lord buddhas
they will also develop the root of virtuous action because they be of benefit to all sentient being
if you ask why
it be because those son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have rejoice in the root of virtuous action of beginner enter the vehicle who be innumerable and immeasurable in number
similarly they have rejoice in the root of virtuous action of those bodhisattva who abide on the first level and similarly of those great-bodhisattva-being who abide on the other level up to and include the tenth level and similarly of those great-bodhisattva-being who be tie to only one more rebirth
those who have actualize the root of virtuous action will approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
after attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
they will bring innumerable countless measureless sentient being to final nirvāṇa in the expanse of nirvāṇa where there be no residue of the psycho physical aggregate
for that reason kauśika
once the son of enlighten heritage or daughter of enlighten heritage have rejoice in the root of virtuous action possess by great-bodhisattva-being who have first begin to set their mind on enlightenment
they should dedicate this merit toward unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment and
they should make this dedication in such a way that they do not engage with mind and do not engage with anything other than mind
similarly once they have rejoice in those root of virtuous action possess by great-bodhisattva-being who already abide on the level up to and include the tenth level and similarly in those root of virtuous action possess by great-bodhisattva-being who be tie to only one more rebirth
then senior su­bhūti ask the blessed one
venerable lord how do the illusion like mind attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti do you think that you should consider this illusion like mind
venerable lord i do not consider illusion or illusion like mind
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti do you think that you should consider that mind which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but in which there be no illusion nor any illusion like mind
no venerable lord
su­bhūti do you think that you should consider anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but which be other than illusion or other than illusion like mind
venerable lord i do not consider anything which would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment but which be other than illusion or other than illusion like mind
venerable lord since i do not consider anything extraneous
what thing existent or non existent could arise
nor could any phenomenon absolutely void be attribute and sustain as existent or non existent
anything that could not be sustain as existent or non existent could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
indeed anything non existent could not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
if one be to ask why
venerable lord it be because all thing that be subject to affliction or purification be non existent
venerable lord so it be that the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely void and
similarly the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity be all absolutely void
in the same vein
all other causal and fruitional attribute up to and include enlightenment be absolutely void
anything that be absolutely void be neither to be cultivate nor not to be cultivate
since this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely void it can not attain anything at all
since this transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely void
how do great-bodhisattva-being attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
since unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment be also absolutely void
how do that which be void actualize that which be void
the blessed one reply to senior su­bhūti as follow
su­bhūti it be so
it be so it be just as you have say
the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and similarly the transcendent-perfection of meditative concentration the transcendent-perfection of perseverance the transcendent-perfection of tolerance the transcendent-perfection of ethical discipline and the transcendent-perfection of generosity be all absolutely void
in the same vein
all causal attribute up to and include enlightenment and all fruitional attribute up to and include omniscience be absolutely void
su­bhūti it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be absolutely void that
su­bhūti great-bodhisattva-being can attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment which be also absolutely void
su­bhūti if the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be not absolutely void and
if all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be not absolutely void
they would not resort to the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom and
all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience would not be existent
therefore su­bhūti it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be void and all attribute and attainment up to and include omniscience be void that
great-bodhisattva-being will attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment dependent on the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
venerable lord although something which be void can not attain manifestly perfect buddhahood which be also void great-bodhisattva-being who practice the sacred doctrine and its profundity do indeed attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
the blessed one reply
su­bhūti it be so
it be just as you have say
great-bodhisattva-being do indeed practice the sacred doctrine and its profundity
su­bhūti although great-bodhisattva-being practice the sacred doctrine and its profundity
they achieve something difficult that be to say they do not at all actualize the goal either of the level of the śrāvaka or of the level of the pratyekabuddha
venerable lord as i understand the meaning of the teaching speak by the lord great-bodhisattva-being do not at all achieve something difficult
if you ask why
it be because they do not apprehend any doctrine or goal that could be actualize
they do not apprehend even the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom through which anything could be actualize nor do they apprehend anything that could bring about actualization
so when all thing be non apprehensible
what be the doctrine what be the purpose what be the intelligence that would bring about actualization
what be the doctrine which having realize all these thing would attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
venerable lord this non apprehending conduct be the conduct of the bodhisattvas
great-bodhisattva-being who practice accordingly will acquire a state that be without obscuration and without blindness with respect to all thing
venerable lord if when such teaching be reveal
the mind of great-bodhisattva-being be not afraid not terrified not fearful and not frightened and if they will not become frightened
then they be actually practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
but they do not consider the fact that they be practice it
they do not consider the fact that they be not practice it
they do not consider the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom
nor do they consider that they should attain manifestly perfect buddhahood in unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
great-bodhisattva-being who practice this profound transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom accordingly do not think i should shun the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha
they do not think i should approach omniscience
if one be to ask why
venerable lord just as space for example do not think i be near or far from anything
owe venerable lord to the fact that space be not particularize owe to its immobility and because it have no concept
in the same way venerable lord although great-bodhisattva-being practice the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom they do not think i be near or far from the level of the śrāvaka or the level of the pratyekabuddha and i be approach unsurpassed genuinely perfect enlightenment
venerable lord it be because the transcendent-perfection-of-wisdom be non conceptual
