but we agree that there be nothing we could do and we become silent 
which complete the taste of the Dharma 
the rākṣasīs come to we and say you who be not master of a house become master 
you who have no refuge obtain a refuge 
you who have no home obtain a home 
these will be your bathing pool for you to enjoy 
after the rākṣasīs have speak to we thus each one take a merchant home to be the master of her house 
the senior rākṣasī take I home to be the master of her house 
she satisfy I with food that have perfect divine flavor 
having satisfied I with food she frolic with I 
and in this way I be perfectly satisfied with human pleasure two or three week pass in that manner

pillar adorn with divine precious jewel 
multistorie building that be cover with gold 
from within that assembly Bodhisattva sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin arise from his seat bare one shoulder and kneel on his right knee and 
face the Bhagavat place his palm together and 
inquire of the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat I have perceive a great wonderful marvel 
who have this power 
noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter the great Avīci hell 
when he have completely liberate the being there he go to the city of the preta 
then sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin ask the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat as the great Avīci hell be without respite 
how do Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter it 
in the great avīci hell a wall enclose a ground make of burn iron 
which have become one rage flame in the shape of a reed basket within this avīci hell there be a pot from which come the sound of wail many hundred of thousand of ten of million of hundred of million of being have be throw into that pot 
just as green or black mung bean be mass together in a water fill vessel rise and sink as they be cook 
that be how the being in the great avīci hell undergo physical suffering 
just as a cakravartin king enter a grove make of divine jewel 
Noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter the great avīci hell 
it have no effect upon his body as he approach the Avīci hell it cool 
why have an inauspicious sign appear in this Avīci hell 
when they arrive they tell he 
Divine One know first that our place of work be completely destroy 
Divine One know first that an inauspicious oman appear in this avīci hell 
there enter a handsome being with his hair in a topknot his body beautify by divine adornment 
the moment he arrive lotus flower the size of cartwheel appear 
Yamarāja wonder 
what deity have manifest this power 
be this a special result that have occur through the blessing of the deity Maheśvara Nārāyaṇa or some other deity have they descend to this level 
or have a powerful rākṣasa be bear who rival great Rāvaṇa 
he look with his divine sight into the heaven wonder whose blessing this could be 
then he look back into the Avīci hell 
and see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara there 
Yamarāja go to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
who bring relief to turtle crocodile and fish 
who create the great mass of wisdom 
who be the one to whom all devas make offering pay homage and show reverence 
who have a beautified body who manifest as the supreme rishi 
who bring freedom from the terror of bondage in stock and manacle 
who have eye like blue lotus 
and who have hundred of thousand of samādhis as numerous as atom 
Noble son he leave the Avīci hell and go to the city of the preta 
mouth the size of a needle ’s eye 
many hundred of thousand of preta come run toward he 
wisdom like a thunderbolt destroy the view of the aggregate as a self which be like a mountain with twenty peak 
and the preta be all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas name Ākāṅkṣitamukha 
Avalokiteśvara having completely liberate those being depart from the city of the preta 
Noble son each day he completely ripen a million trillion being 
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin ask he 
Bhagavat how be that so 
here appear in this world 
the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha perfect in wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of god and human the buddha the Bhagavat Vipaśyin 
when those deity have come from Avalokiteśvara ’s body 
that bhagavat tell the deity Maheśvara 
in a later time there appear in this world the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha the one with wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of god and human the buddha the Bhagavat Śikhin 
when all the devas nāgas yakṣas rākṣasas gandharvas asura garuḍas kiṃnara mahoraga and human have gather together 
the bhagavat Śikhin look at the great gathering and begin to speak of the Dharma within that assembly 
at that time light ray of various color emanate from the mouth of Bhagavat Śikhin they be blue yellow red white orange and the color of crystal and of silver 
the ground appear to be make of gold 
then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi ask Bhagavat Śikhin 
Bhagavat what be these omen of 
and that be why these omen appear 
as the earth shake and it rain beautiful lotus 
he bow down his head to the bhagavat ’ foot and offer the lotus to he he say Tathāgata Amitābha send these flower to you the Tathagāta ask if you be in health if you be at ease and if all be well 
how do you Avalokiteśvara accomplish your task 
among the preta the being in the Avīci hell the being in Kālasūtra and Raurava the being in Hāhava Tāpana the great hell Pretāyana the great hell Agnighaṭa the great hell Śālmali the great hell Śītodaka and other 
the being in those great hell be my task 
I will completely ripen those being 
and then I will bring they to the high complete enlightenment 
if someone be for a deva ’s eon to serve tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha as numerous as the grain of sand in the Ganges with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
noble son it be like this as a comparison I can count every hair on all the four legged creature in the four great continent such as lion tiger bear hyena deer camel jackal and so on and oxen donkey cattle elephant horse buffalo and cat 
noble son it be like this as a comparison I can count the number of leave in a forest of agarwood tree but 
I can not calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit 
Noble son it be like this as a comparison if all the woman man boy and girl in the four great continent 
be to gain the result of become stream entrant once returner non - returner arhat and pratyekabuddhas 
Noble son even if all who be tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha like I 
be gather in one place and provide for an eon with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
those tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha would still not be able to calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit 
so noble son it be needless to say that I can not do so all by myself in this world 
those who remember Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s name will have happiness in this world 
and will remain in that realm until Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s powerful commitment be fulfil and all being have be bring to liberation 
then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi ask Bhagavat Śikhin 
he completely ripen the many being who circle in saṃsāra 
he teach the Dharma in the form of a pratyekabuddha to being who be to be teach by a pratyekabuddha 
he teach the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to being who be to be teach by a yakṣa 
he teach the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to being who be to be teach by Vaiśravaṇa 
Noble son in this Jambudvīpa there be a cave name Vajrakukṣi in which a hundred thousand million time ten million asura live 
at the time of death twelve tathāgata will come and 
noble son do not be afraid 
you have hear the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
you have prepare various parasol various crown various earring and various necklace 
when that kind of omen appear at death they will go without impediment to Sukhāvatī 
when the asura king Bali see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approach from the distance 
he go toward Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara accompany by his queen his retinue and many asura such as Kubja and Vāmanaka with their retinue Bali bow down at his foot and say these word 
Bali offer a bejewel throne to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and 
Bhagavat look with compassion upon those who like to perform bad action who lust after the wife of other who be dedicate to kill who kill other and who be old and die 
you lord be our father and mother and show the path to we who be bind in bondage 
I will explain how much merit be acquire by those who give alm to a tathāgata an arhat a samyaksaṃbuddha 
as a comparison be there to be as many bodhisattva like myself as there be grain of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers 
as a comparison I can count how many atom there be but 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit through that alm give 
as a comparison if all the man woman boy and girl in the four continent be to apply themselves to work 
as a comparison I can count each drop in the vast extent of the ocean but 
and then if the man woman boy and girl be to load that mustard into cart bag and basket onto camel donkey and cattle and 
collect the great harvest together and 
then if the donkey and cattle thresh it to make a vast heap of mustard seed 
Noble son it be like this 
as a comparison the low half of the supreme mountain Sumeru extend downward for 84,000 yojana 
if the vast ocean be to become an inkwell 
and if all the man woman boy and girl who live in the four continent be to become scribe 
and if they be to write on the limitless endless extent of Mount Sumeru as birch bark I would be able to count each letter 
as a comparison if all those scribe be to become bodhisattva on the tenth bhūmi 
then the accumulation of merit of all those bodhisattva on the tenth bhūmi would then equal the accumulation of merit through that alm give 
as a comparison I can count each grain of sand in the ocean 
but I make my offering not know that and make an offering to a petitioner who come to I in the form of a dwarf 
I have prepare offering of elephant- and horse draw cart carry diadem earring and necklace 
hang with precious yak tail whisk and cover with string of pearl a net of pearl as a rear adornment 
and jingle golden bell hang from silver cord 
I have also prepare offering of a thousand tawny cow with silver hoof golden horn and cover with net of pearl 
wear diadem earring and necklace 
adorn with armlet bracelet anklet and girdle 
and wear ring sash necklace and gold ring on the big toe of their left foot 
they jingle as they move and wear clothing of silk in a variety of color 
I have also prepare a hundred thousand precious seat numerous heap of gold heap of silver and heap of jewel 
be you alive or dead 
and one day in the form of a man 
daśaratha­putra seize the opportunity quickly remove the seven mountain throw they to another place 
he then shout loudly to the kṣatriyas 
the other king hear he and be relieve and comfort 
then the great hero destroy all the door and look inside the copper cave 
all the bind king see Nārāyaṇa 
they discuss among each other say either the time have come for the asura king Bali to die or the time have come for we to be slay 
it be good if we die in battle but it ’s not good to die in chain 
they say to each other 
Daśaratha­putra transform himself into a dwarf who wear a deerskin as a sash hold a bamboo staff and carry a stool 
he come to where I be and arrive at my door 
your Majesty a brahmin dwarf have arrive here 
your Majesty I do n’t know 
go and bring the brahmin to I 
the guard summon he say come in great brahmin 
then he come inside and be place on a precious seat 
Bhagavat how do you know that 
I know by see his sign and omen 
then Nārāyaṇa appear in his own form he be vast with the sun and moon on his shoulder 
and hold a sword a bow a wheel a long spear and a short spear in his hand 
Nārāyaṇa take two step and say give I my third step 
I say there can be no third 
wherever I place you there shall you stay 
be this true be this true 
it ’ the truth it ’ the truth 
thus Nārāyaṇa catch I in the noose of truth 
the offering site be destroy and the offering bowl discard 
Homage to you lord 
then Nārāyaṇa take I my queen and my retinue and place we in the underworld 
in the past I make that gift to a bad recipient 
the one who wear a matted topknot 
the one who have beautiful eye like parasol 
to the one who be a teacher of the six perfection and to the one whose thought be good 
I make this praise 
the being who remember your name Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have happiness 
you lord of the asura will become the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha perfect in wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of devas and human the buddha the Bhagavat Śrī 
as a gift with which to request the Dharma Bali present Avalokiteśvara with string of pearl worth a hundred thousand silver coin and diadem adorn with various jewel 
human being be continually think about transitory thing about acquisition about great pleasure about male and female slave servant and hire worker about costly clothe bed and seat about valuable treasure rich store of grain and storeroom about son and daughter and about wife and parent 
they be ignorant 
those thing that they be attach to appear as dream do 
they will see the great tree that blaze with fire blaze strongly and blaze fiercely 
when they see they they will be terrify 
bind they with noose and drag they away 
numerous raven vulture eagle and dog will devour they 
they will experience the sensation of great suffering in the hell 
when they step off the great road of razor five hundred thorn each with sixteen spike will pierce each foot 
they will cry out what have I who delight in bad action do 
Yama ’s servant will reply 
friend you do not offer alm to the Tathāgata 
you do not hear the gaṇḍī be beat 
to that they will reply 
you do not circumambulate a stūpa anywhere 
we be without faith delight in bad action reject the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha 
and be experience the result of those action 
Yama ’ guardian will then take they to King Yama 
bring they before he and present they to he 
King Yama will say 
show they today your place of work 
so Yama ’ guardian will bring they to the great Kālasūtra hell and put they into it 
inside there though a hundred spear strike they they will not die 
though a hundred spear strike they a second time they will not die 
though a hundred spear strike they a third time they still will not die 
because they will not die they be throw into a furnace 
but there they still will not die 
a red hot metal ball will be insert into their mouth 
incinerate their lip destroy their tooth 
split their palate 
and loudly burn up their throat gullet heart anus and whole body 
it be like this great king there will be no one to protect they in that other world 
great king you must diligently create merit in this life 
Bhagavat where do these light ray come from 
noble son the light ray come from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who be in the palace of Bali the lord of the asura 
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja then ask Bhagavat Viśvabhū 
be there a way for I to see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
when Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leave the palace of Bali lord of the asura 
divine flower fall on Jetavana Monastery 
and extremely beautiful wish grant tree appear there they be hang with hundred of thousand of adornment 
they become happy as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrive there and with joy in their heart 
they run to he when they come to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara they pay homage at his foot and ask 
you be not tired you be not exhausted 
those who hear and then possess study promulgate and have their mind completely focus on even one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
will be inspire to accumulate merit 
noble son it be like this 
for example I can count the drop in the vast ocean but 
if tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha as numerous as the grain of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers be gather together in one place and 
for twelve eon be provide with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil they would still not be able to calculate the merit that come from even one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display so it be needless to say that I can not do so all by myself in Tamondhakāra 
the accumulation of merit from one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s display would be far great than the merit from insert the relic 
for example even if all the household in the four continent build monastery of gold and jewel and build a thousand stūpas inside each of those monastery and in one day insert relic in they all 
for example just as the five great river flow into the great ocean 
those who always possess and remember the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
will be completely liberate from the suffering of saṃsāra and be completely liberate from birth aging sickness death misery lamentation suffering unhappiness and conflict 
and they will have immense powerful strength 
but Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara say to they 
I have to bring many being onto the path to enlightenment 
Avalokiteśvara come to that deva in the form of the brahmin and say to he 
I ’m hungry and thirsty 
you should give I what little you have 
Sukuṇḍala think without a doubt the one at my door be an excellent recipient for offering and he have bring I this attainment of splendor 
Sukuṇḍala invite the brahmin into his divine palace the brahmin enter and 
Sukuṇḍala offer he the divine jewel 
serve he the food with divine perfect flavor and 
the brahmin eat and recite a benediction 
great brahmin where do you come from 
I come from the monastery name Jetavana 
what be that place like 
the deva Sukuṇḍala then ask he 
Son of a deva that be how pleasant that place be 
I be not a deva and I be not a human 
these be your home with food home with drink and home with clothe and a variety of multicolore bed beautiful garden and beautiful pool 
only if you do as I command 
we will 
he then teach they the noble eightfold path 
he make they recite the fourfold scripture 
some of they attain the result of become a once returner 
they continually delight in the Dharma and they take vow 
they promise we shall kill no more 
when Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrive there he transform himself into the form of a bee that make a buzzing sound that be hear by the insect as the word 
Namo buddhāya namo dharmāya namaḥ saṃghāya the insect remember the word namo buddhāya namo dharmāya namaḥ saṃghāya and the thunderbolt of wisdom destroy the mountain which have twenty peak that be the view of the aggregate as a self 
the man begin to describe Avalokiteśvara ’ quality to they 
he be a lamp for those in darkness 
those who continually gather and offer flower and incense to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
will become cakravartin king who possess the seven jewel 
those who offer flower to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have aromatic body and 
wherever they be reborn their body will be perfect 
the old man teach Avalokiteśvara ’s special quality in that way 
then those gather there return to their home 
and the aged man having teach they an appropriate Dharma return to his home 
and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara vanish into the sky 
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja ask Bhagavat Viśvabhū 
Bhagavat which bodhisattva be arrive 
be you tired be you weary noble son what work have you be do 
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja be extremely amazed 
I have never see such a field of activity as that of this bodhisattva 
Seated he ask Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
be you tired be you weary 
I be not tired and I be not weary 
they talk with each other and then become silent 
similarly you must complete the perfection of conduct the perfection of patience the perfection of diligence the perfection of meditation and the perfection of wisdom 
Bodhisattva sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin then say to the Bhagavat 
the samādhi name Creation 
the samādhi name Illumination 
the samādhi name Sublime Vajra 
he samādhi name Armlet 
the samādhi name Ornament 
the samādhi name Aspiration 
so we set sail in the great ship in the direction of Siṃhala Island 
but the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island send untimely wind 
that break the great ship into piece we fall into the water and 
swam to the shore 
these will be your home supply with food these will be your home supply with drink these will be your garden for you to enjoy 
she be go to kill you 
I ask it how do you know she be a rākṣasī 
I make the sound of spitting and 
the merchant inside hear I they say great head merchant know this we have be throw into this iron fortress each day a hundred man be take and eat 
when they have be eat their bone be scatter around the iron fortress 
that be how they describe what have happen to they I climb down the magnolia tree and 
go quickly back up the southern road 
when I return to the house the lamp ask I Head merchant do you see 
I answer I see 
and then ask it what can I do 
shake his body 
and then ask who be go to cross over to the far shore 
you should then say Lord I be go to cross over to the far shore 
once the lamp have tell I this I go to lie down next to the rākṣasī she awake and ask I 
that ’s why my body have become cold 
and so she go back to sleep 
at sunrise I get up 
and say to all the merchant come with I 
we be go outside the town 
I ask they how affectionate be your wife toward you 
each person should prepare provision for the journey 
they promise they would and return to town each to their own home 
have you see the delightful garden and the delightful bathing pool 
I will gather beautiful flower there and then return therefore you should prepare good travel provision for I 
she say noble son I will do so 
I contemplate my predicament think these rākṣasīs will kill we if they find out 
I remain silent contemplate this predicament 
the rākṣasī serve I good food and as I eat it I sigh 
the rākṣasī ask I noble son why do you sigh 
Noble son what would you do in your homeland 
why be sorrowful in Jambudvīpa 
I say nothing in reply 
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara be Bālāha the king of horse and he rescue I from the fear of death 
I can not calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit but 
I can say just a little about his pore 
a trillion gandharvas dwell in a pore name Suvarṇa 
they perceive divine object but be free from attachment 
they have no aversion they do not become angry 
and they never have malice 
in this pore name Suvarṇa there be a wish fulfil jewel name Avabhāsa 
those rishis have leaf hut where there be wish fulfil tree with red trunk and gold and silver leave that shine like jewel 
sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin it be like this 
there be four pool near each wish fulfil tree 
they see birth aging and death 
they see separation from the desire and beloved and encounter with the disliked 
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin say to the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat I be utterly astonish 
Bhagavat if those kind of thing appear just because someone think of the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
then those who listen to cause to be write out possess recite study and have their mind completely focus on the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display will have happiness 
those who write a single letter from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display will have happiness and 
will not see these suffering of saṃsāra 
the Bhagavat give his approval say that be excellent 
sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin your eloquence and your teaching of this kind of Dharma to a gathering of devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asura garuḍas kiṃnara mahoragas human nonhuman upāsakas and upāsikās be excellent excellent 
then Bodhisattva sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin say to the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat when you teach what I request the devas gain unwavering faith 
be beautiful and attractive 
have magnificent fair complexion 
their body be adorn with divine jewelry 
and they rival the apsarase 
even though they have this beauty they be not afflict by the suffering of desire 
Bhagavat if Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra do not see they 
why should I go 
as be a great yogin a sublime yogin 
as be with form a vast form a hundred thousand arm a trillion eye and eleven head 
Bhagavat how can I see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
Noble son you will see he if he come here to the Sahā universe to look at I bow down to I and honor I 
I request it Bhagavat that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara may come 
Noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara first come when a being be ripen 
what point be there in my have a long life that be devoted to bad action deprive of the sight of Avalokiteśvara blind and follow a path of darkness 
Bhagavat when be Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara come

and hang with string of jewel 
these wish fulfil tree around the walkway be like many storied mansion 
the kiṃnara contemplate in that way 
and follow that contemplation they contemplate the essence of nirvāṇa 
Bhagavat where can the six syllable mahāvidyā be obtain 
noble son even the tathāgata do not know the six syllable mahāvidyā let alone the bodhisattvas 
Bhagavat do the tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddhas not know it 
noble son the six syllable mahāvidyā be the supreme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
Bhagavat be there any being who know the six syllable vidyāmantra 
Noble son no one know the six syllable mahāvidyā 
reside there they give their approval say excellent excellent noble son you have acquire such a wish fulfil jewel as this seven generation of your descendant will attain liberation noble son even all the being who live in your stomach will become irreversible bodhisattva 
will be know to be a stūpa contain relic 
and will be know to be the wisdom of ten million tathāgata 
woman man boy and girl who just see that person 
which be the inconceivable yoga and the immeasurable and high dhyāna 
which show the way to the nirvāṇa of supreme enlightenment 
which be the entranceway into liberation 
and which be the imperishable teaching of omniscience 
Bhagavat how can I obtain it 
would offer the four continent fill with the seven precious material to anyone who bestow upon I the six syllable mahāvidyā 
Bhagavat I have no concern for my body the one who bestow it upon I will be my parent my guru of guru 
at that time I go weeping to the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha the one with wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of god and human the buddha the Bhagavat Ratnottama 
I place my palm together before he 
this six syllable mahāvidyā which purify all bad karma merely by the remembrance of its name 
then Tathāgata Padmottama praise the quality of this six syllable mahāvidyā 
as a comparison I can know the number of atom but 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
Noble son it be like this as a comparison I can count the grain of sand in the ocean but 
as a comparison a person build a building that be a hundred yojana high 
but noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
as a comparison if the people in the four continent be all to work at various kind of agriculture such as barley wheat rice green or black mung bean and so on and jujube horse gram and so on 
then noble son I could count every single grain 
as a comparison in Jambudvīpa there be great river that flow day and night 
they be the Sītā the Ganges the Yamuna the Indus the Pakṣu the Sutlej the Chenab the Ravi the Sumāgandha the Himavatī and the Godavari 
each of these river have five hundred tributary 
I can count each drop in those great river but 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
as a comparison I can count each hair on all four legged being such as herd of oxen donkey buffalo horse and elephant dog jackal goat and similarly lion tiger wolf deer monkey hare pig and so on and rat and cat and so on but 
as a comparison the king of mountain name Vajrāṅkuśa be 99,000 yojana high and extend downward into the sea for 84,000 yojana 
Noble son it be like this 
the ocean be 84,000 yojana deep and it have an immeasurable expanse extend as far as Vaḍavāmukha I can count all its drop of water which be the size of the tip of a hair but 
as a comparison I can count the number of leave in a forest of agarwood tree but noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
as a comparison even if all the man woman boy and girl who live in the four continent be to be on the seventh bodhisattva bhūmi 
or with a leap month to make a year of thirteen month it be to rain day and night noble son I could count each drop of rain but 
there be no need to say much but if for example a million tathāgata like I be to be in one place for an eon provide with all requirement with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
still those tathāgata would not be able to calculate the accumulation of merit from the six syllable mahāvidyā 
so it be needless to say that I can not do so all by myself in this world 
Noble son I have enter the yoga of meditation through an inconceivable dhyāna 
an imperceptible Dharma an unknown Dharma it be the attainment of the ultimate essence 
Noble son I also wander through many hundred of thousand of million of ten of million of world and then 
in front of Tathāgata Amitābha with palm place together I weep because of my emotion for the Dharma 
at that time Tathāgata Amitābha who know the present and the future

these be the feature of the maṇḍala 
to create the body of Tathāgata Amitābha sprinkle powder make from precious sapphire powder emerald powder ruby powder crystal powder and powder silver and gold 
all vighna and vināyaka yakṣas and rākṣasa together with the company of mahākāla and mātṛs flee 
Meritorious be those being who with high motivation possess this six syllable mahāvidyā and repeat listen to and contemplate it 
the samādhi name Jewel Holder

before whom devas nāgas yakṣas mahoragas and human have gather 
from within that assembly of bodhisattvas the bodhisattva name Gaganagañja arise from his seat 
what need be there to say more 
bare one shoulder and kneel on his right knee and face Bhagavat Viśvabhū place his palm together and address these word to he 
and pool that be completely fill with flower 
Bhikṣus a bhikṣu with incorrect conduct can not establish the various location for ordination let alone make the fourth motion 
then Bodhisattva Gaganagañja ask Bhagavat Viśvabhū 
Bhagavat be Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara not come 
they destroy the teaching 
Noble son he have leave the palace of Bali lord of the asura and be go to an extremely dreadful land name Tamondhakāra where there be no human 
those who have incorrect conduct should not dwell among those who receive offering 
they should dwell outside the monastery 
the saṅgha ’ alm should not be give to they 
they be not worthy to be in the saṅgha 
they have no part of be a bhikṣu 
Brother Ānanda ask the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat in what time will they become recipient of offering 
there noble son the sun and moon do not shine 
a wish fulfil jewel name Varada provide light in that place 
many hundred of thousand of yakṣas and rākṣasa live in that continent 
they will see the monastery as their home

they will also spit in the place the saṅgha use not know the karma that ripen from it 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from even one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
those who use the toothpick of the saṅgha which be prohibit to they will be reborn as turtle crocodile and fish 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
  noble son it be like this for example I know the number of atom that exist but 
those who use the saṅgha ’s sesame rice millet horse gram and other grain which be not for they to eat will be reborn in the city of the preta 
those who use the food of the saṅgha to feed dog will be reborn in a low caste 
with defective faculty 
they will be like burn tree trunk like stand skeleton cover with hair with stomach the size of mountain and mouth the size of a needle ’s eye they will experience that kind of physical suffering 
Seated he teach the Dharma to the yakṣas and rākṣasa   listen 
cripple and hunchbacke

the tendon in their body will shrink 
when they stand up red lump of their flesh will fall onto the ground and their bone will be expose 
they will experience that kind of suffer for many year for many hundred of thousand of year 
those who use land exclusive to the saṅgha will be reborn in the Raurava great hell for twelve eon 
Lumps of red hot iron will be squeeze into their mouth burn they destroy their lip and tooth split their palate burn their throat and burn their heart and all their entrail until there be nothing leave but bone 
Bhikṣus at that time the wind of karma will blow and although they have die they will come back to life 
then Yama ’ guard will again seize they 
their karma will come they will be under the power of their karma their tongue will become vast and a hundred thousand plow will plow they 
they will experience that kind of suffer in that hell for hundred of thousand of year

when they die they will be reborn in other hell 
they will wander in that way for three eon when they die and leave the hell they will be reborn in Jambudvīpa as poor people blind from birth 
therefore Ānanda protect the property of the saṅgha

one Dharma robe be wear by the saṅgha so that there will be confidence in the saṅgha 
the second robe be for when one go to the king ’s palace 
the third robe be for when one go to the village town marketplace and hamlet 
so the bhikṣus must have the three robe

Maheśvara in the kaliyuga when being have bad nature you will be declare to be the primal deity who be the creator the maker 
all those being will be exclude from the path to enlightenment

for that purpose I have be to many world in distress I have arrive here exhausted and without any result 
when we be outside the town and have sit down 
some say she be very loving toward I

some say I do n’t have to do any physical work 
some say she care for I with sandalwood musk and camphor 
and five hundred yojana wide

pillar adorn with divine precious jewel 
multistorie building that be cover with gold 
from within that assembly Bodhisattva sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin arise from his seat bare one shoulder and kneel on his right knee and 
face the Bhagavat place his palm together and 
inquire of the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat I have perceive a great wonderful marvel 
who have this power 
noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter the great Avīci hell 
when he have completely liberate the being there he go to the city of the preta 
then sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin ask the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat as the great Avīci hell be without respite 
how do Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter it 
in the great avīci hell a wall enclose a ground make of burn iron 
which have become one rage flame in the shape of a reed basket within this avīci hell there be a pot from which come the sound of wail many hundred of thousand of ten of million of hundred of million of being have be throw into that pot 
just as green or black mung bean be mass together in a water fill vessel rise and sink as they be cook 
that be how the being in the great avīci hell undergo physical suffering 
just as a cakravartin king enter a grove make of divine jewel 
Noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara enter the great avīci hell 
it have no effect upon his body as he approach the Avīci hell it cool 
why have an inauspicious sign appear in this Avīci hell 
when they arrive they tell he 
Divine One know first that our place of work be completely destroy 
Divine One know first that an inauspicious oman appear in this avīci hell 
there enter a handsome being with his hair in a topknot his body beautify by divine adornment 
the moment he arrive lotus flower the size of cartwheel appear 
Yamarāja wonder 
what deity have manifest this power 
be this a special result that have occur through the blessing of the deity Maheśvara Nārāyaṇa or some other deity have they descend to this level 
or have a powerful rākṣasa be bear who rival great Rāvaṇa 
he look with his divine sight into the heaven wonder whose blessing this could be 
then he look back into the Avīci hell 
and see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara there 
Yamarāja go to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
who bring relief to turtle crocodile and fish 
who create the great mass of wisdom 
who be the one to whom all devas make offering pay homage and show reverence 
who have a beautified body who manifest as the supreme rishi 
who bring freedom from the terror of bondage in stock and manacle 
who have eye like blue lotus 
and who have hundred of thousand of samādhis as numerous as atom 
Noble son he leave the Avīci hell and go to the city of the preta 
mouth the size of a needle ’s eye 
many hundred of thousand of preta come run toward he 
wisdom like a thunderbolt destroy the view of the aggregate as a self which be like a mountain with twenty peak 
and the preta be all reborn in the realm of Sukhāvatī as bodhisattvas name Ākāṅkṣitamukha 
Avalokiteśvara having completely liberate those being depart from the city of the preta 
Noble son each day he completely ripen a million trillion being 
Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin ask he 
Bhagavat how be that so 
here appear in this world 
the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha perfect in wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of god and human the buddha the Bhagavat Vipaśyin 
when those deity have come from Avalokiteśvara ’s body 
that bhagavat tell the deity Maheśvara 
in a later time there appear in this world the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha the one with wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of god and human the buddha the Bhagavat Śikhin 
when all the devas nāgas yakṣas rākṣasas gandharvas asura garuḍas kiṃnara mahoraga and human have gather together 
the bhagavat Śikhin look at the great gathering and begin to speak of the Dharma within that assembly 
at that time light ray of various color emanate from the mouth of Bhagavat Śikhin they be blue yellow red white orange and the color of crystal and of silver 
the ground appear to be make of gold 
then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi ask Bhagavat Śikhin 
Bhagavat what be these omen of 
and that be why these omen appear 
as the earth shake and it rain beautiful lotus 
he bow down his head to the bhagavat ’ foot and offer the lotus to he he say Tathāgata Amitābha send these flower to you the Tathagāta ask if you be in health if you be at ease and if all be well 
how do you Avalokiteśvara accomplish your task 
among the preta the being in the Avīci hell the being in Kālasūtra and Raurava the being in Hāhava Tāpana the great hell Pretāyana the great hell Agnighaṭa the great hell Śālmali the great hell Śītodaka and other 
the being in those great hell be my task 
I will completely ripen those being 
and then I will bring they to the high complete enlightenment 
if someone be for a deva ’s eon to serve tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha as numerous as the grain of sand in the Ganges with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
noble son it be like this as a comparison I can count every hair on all the four legged creature in the four great continent such as lion tiger bear hyena deer camel jackal and so on and oxen donkey cattle elephant horse buffalo and cat 
noble son it be like this as a comparison I can count the number of leave in a forest of agarwood tree but 
I can not calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit 
Noble son it be like this as a comparison if all the woman man boy and girl in the four great continent 
be to gain the result of become stream entrant once returner non - returner arhat and pratyekabuddhas 
Noble son even if all who be tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha like I 
be gather in one place and provide for an eon with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
those tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha would still not be able to calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit 
so noble son it be needless to say that I can not do so all by myself in this world 
those who remember Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s name will have happiness in this world 
and will remain in that realm until Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s powerful commitment be fulfil and all being have be bring to liberation 
then Bodhisattva Ratnapāṇi ask Bhagavat Śikhin 
he completely ripen the many being who circle in saṃsāra 
he teach the Dharma in the form of a pratyekabuddha to being who be to be teach by a pratyekabuddha 
he teach the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to being who be to be teach by a yakṣa 
he teach the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to being who be to be teach by Vaiśravaṇa 
Noble son in this Jambudvīpa there be a cave name Vajrakukṣi in which a hundred thousand million time ten million asura live 
at the time of death twelve tathāgata will come and 
noble son do not be afraid 
you have hear the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
you have prepare various parasol various crown various earring and various necklace 
when that kind of omen appear at death they will go without impediment to Sukhāvatī 
when the asura king Bali see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara approach from the distance 
he go toward Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara accompany by his queen his retinue and many asura such as Kubja and Vāmanaka with their retinue Bali bow down at his foot and say these word 
Bali offer a bejewel throne to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara and 
Bhagavat look with compassion upon those who like to perform bad action who lust after the wife of other who be dedicate to kill who kill other and who be old and die 
you lord be our father and mother and show the path to we who be bind in bondage 
I will explain how much merit be acquire by those who give alm to a tathāgata an arhat a samyaksaṃbuddha 
as a comparison be there to be as many bodhisattva like myself as there be grain of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers 
as a comparison I can count how many atom there be but 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit through that alm give 
as a comparison if all the man woman boy and girl in the four continent be to apply themselves to work 
as a comparison I can count each drop in the vast extent of the ocean but 
and then if the man woman boy and girl be to load that mustard into cart bag and basket onto camel donkey and cattle and 
collect the great harvest together and 
then if the donkey and cattle thresh it to make a vast heap of mustard seed 
Noble son it be like this 
as a comparison the low half of the supreme mountain Sumeru extend downward for 84,000 yojana 
if the vast ocean be to become an inkwell 
and if all the man woman boy and girl who live in the four continent be to become scribe 
and if they be to write on the limitless endless extent of Mount Sumeru as birch bark I would be able to count each letter 
as a comparison if all those scribe be to become bodhisattva on the tenth bhūmi 
then the accumulation of merit of all those bodhisattva on the tenth bhūmi would then equal the accumulation of merit through that alm give 
as a comparison I can count each grain of sand in the ocean 
but I make my offering not know that and make an offering to a petitioner who come to I in the form of a dwarf 
I have prepare offering of elephant- and horse draw cart carry diadem earring and necklace 
hang with precious yak tail whisk and cover with string of pearl a net of pearl as a rear adornment 
and jingle golden bell hang from silver cord 
I have also prepare offering of a thousand tawny cow with silver hoof golden horn and cover with net of pearl 
wear diadem earring and necklace 
adorn with armlet bracelet anklet and girdle 
and wear ring sash necklace and gold ring on the big toe of their left foot 
they jingle as they move and wear clothing of silk in a variety of color 
I have also prepare a hundred thousand precious seat numerous heap of gold heap of silver and heap of jewel 
be you alive or dead 
and one day in the form of a man 
daśaratha­putra seize the opportunity quickly remove the seven mountain throw they to another place 
he then shout loudly to the kṣatriyas 
the other king hear he and be relieve and comfort 
then the great hero destroy all the door and look inside the copper cave 
all the bind king see Nārāyaṇa 
they discuss among each other say either the time have come for the asura king Bali to die or the time have come for we to be slay 
it be good if we die in battle but it ’s not good to die in chain 
they say to each other 
Daśaratha­putra transform himself into a dwarf who wear a deerskin as a sash hold a bamboo staff and carry a stool 
he come to where I be and arrive at my door 
your Majesty a brahmin dwarf have arrive here 
your Majesty I do n’t know 
go and bring the brahmin to I 
the guard summon he say come in great brahmin 
then he come inside and be place on a precious seat 
Bhagavat how do you know that 
I know by see his sign and omen 
then Nārāyaṇa appear in his own form he be vast with the sun and moon on his shoulder 
and hold a sword a bow a wheel a long spear and a short spear in his hand 
Nārāyaṇa take two step and say give I my third step 
I say there can be no third 
wherever I place you there shall you stay 
be this true be this true 
it ’ the truth it ’ the truth 
thus Nārāyaṇa catch I in the noose of truth 
the offering site be destroy and the offering bowl discard 
Homage to you lord 
then Nārāyaṇa take I my queen and my retinue and place we in the underworld 
in the past I make that gift to a bad recipient 
the one who wear a matted topknot 
the one who have beautiful eye like parasol 
to the one who be a teacher of the six perfection and to the one whose thought be good 
I make this praise 
the being who remember your name Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have happiness 
you lord of the asura will become the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha perfect in wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of devas and human the buddha the Bhagavat Śrī 
as a gift with which to request the Dharma Bali present Avalokiteśvara with string of pearl worth a hundred thousand silver coin and diadem adorn with various jewel 
human being be continually think about transitory thing about acquisition about great pleasure about male and female slave servant and hire worker about costly clothe bed and seat about valuable treasure rich store of grain and storeroom about son and daughter and about wife and parent 
they be ignorant 
those thing that they be attach to appear as dream do 
they will see the great tree that blaze with fire blaze strongly and blaze fiercely 
when they see they they will be terrify 
bind they with noose and drag they away 
numerous raven vulture eagle and dog will devour they 
they will experience the sensation of great suffering in the hell 
when they step off the great road of razor five hundred thorn each with sixteen spike will pierce each foot 
they will cry out what have I who delight in bad action do 
Yama ’s servant will reply 
friend you do not offer alm to the Tathāgata 
you do not hear the gaṇḍī be beat 
to that they will reply 
you do not circumambulate a stūpa anywhere 
we be without faith delight in bad action reject the Buddha Dharma and Saṅgha 
and be experience the result of those action 
Yama ’ guardian will then take they to King Yama 
bring they before he and present they to he 
King Yama will say 
show they today your place of work 
so Yama ’ guardian will bring they to the great Kālasūtra hell and put they into it 
inside there though a hundred spear strike they they will not die 
though a hundred spear strike they a second time they will not die 
though a hundred spear strike they a third time they still will not die 
because they will not die they be throw into a furnace 
but there they still will not die 
a red hot metal ball will be insert into their mouth 
incinerate their lip destroy their tooth 
split their palate 
and loudly burn up their throat gullet heart anus and whole body 
it be like this great king there will be no one to protect they in that other world 
great king you must diligently create merit in this life 
Bhagavat where do these light ray come from 
noble son the light ray come from Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara who be in the palace of Bali the lord of the asura 
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja then ask Bhagavat Viśvabhū 
be there a way for I to see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
when Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara leave the palace of Bali lord of the asura 
divine flower fall on Jetavana Monastery 
and extremely beautiful wish grant tree appear there they be hang with hundred of thousand of adornment 
they become happy as Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrive there and with joy in their heart 
they run to he when they come to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara they pay homage at his foot and ask 
you be not tired you be not exhausted 
those who hear and then possess study promulgate and have their mind completely focus on even one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
will be inspire to accumulate merit 
noble son it be like this 
for example I can count the drop in the vast ocean but 
if tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha as numerous as the grain of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers be gather together in one place and 
for twelve eon be provide with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil they would still not be able to calculate the merit that come from even one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display so it be needless to say that I can not do so all by myself in Tamondhakāra 
the accumulation of merit from one four line verse of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s display would be far great than the merit from insert the relic 
for example even if all the household in the four continent build monastery of gold and jewel and build a thousand stūpas inside each of those monastery and in one day insert relic in they all 
for example just as the five great river flow into the great ocean 
those who always possess and remember the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
will be completely liberate from the suffering of saṃsāra and be completely liberate from birth aging sickness death misery lamentation suffering unhappiness and conflict 
and they will have immense powerful strength 
but Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara say to they 
I have to bring many being onto the path to enlightenment 
Avalokiteśvara come to that deva in the form of the brahmin and say to he 
I ’m hungry and thirsty 
you should give I what little you have 
Sukuṇḍala think without a doubt the one at my door be an excellent recipient for offering and he have bring I this attainment of splendor 
Sukuṇḍala invite the brahmin into his divine palace the brahmin enter and 
Sukuṇḍala offer he the divine jewel 
serve he the food with divine perfect flavor and 
the brahmin eat and recite a benediction 
great brahmin where do you come from 
I come from the monastery name Jetavana 
what be that place like 
the deva Sukuṇḍala then ask he 
Son of a deva that be how pleasant that place be 
I be not a deva and I be not a human 
these be your home with food home with drink and home with clothe and a variety of multicolore bed beautiful garden and beautiful pool 
only if you do as I command 
we will 
he then teach they the noble eightfold path 
he make they recite the fourfold scripture 
some of they attain the result of become a once returner 
they continually delight in the Dharma and they take vow 
they promise we shall kill no more 
when Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara arrive there he transform himself into the form of a bee that make a buzzing sound that be hear by the insect as the word 
Namo buddhāya namo dharmāya namaḥ saṃghāya the insect remember the word namo buddhāya namo dharmāya namaḥ saṃghāya and the thunderbolt of wisdom destroy the mountain which have twenty peak that be the view of the aggregate as a self 
the man begin to describe Avalokiteśvara ’ quality to they 
he be a lamp for those in darkness 
those who continually gather and offer flower and incense to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
will become cakravartin king who possess the seven jewel 
those who offer flower to Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will have aromatic body and 
wherever they be reborn their body will be perfect 
the old man teach Avalokiteśvara ’s special quality in that way 
then those gather there return to their home 
and the aged man having teach they an appropriate Dharma return to his home 
and Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara vanish into the sky 
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja ask Bhagavat Viśvabhū 
Bhagavat which bodhisattva be arrive 
be you tired be you weary noble son what work have you be do 
Bodhisattva Gaganagañja be extremely amazed 
I have never see such a field of activity as that of this bodhisattva 
Seated he ask Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
be you tired be you weary 
I be not tired and I be not weary 
they talk with each other and then become silent 
similarly you must complete the perfection of conduct the perfection of patience the perfection of diligence the perfection of meditation and the perfection of wisdom 
Bodhisattva sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin then say to the Bhagavat 
the samādhi name Creation 
the samādhi name Illumination 
the samādhi name Sublime Vajra 
he samādhi name Armlet 
the samādhi name Ornament 
the samādhi name Aspiration 
so we set sail in the great ship in the direction of Siṃhala Island 
but the rākṣasīs who live on Siṃhala Island send untimely wind 
that break the great ship into piece we fall into the water and 
swam to the shore 
these will be your home supply with food these will be your home supply with drink these will be your garden for you to enjoy

she say noble son I will do so 
I contemplate my predicament think these rākṣasīs will kill we if they find out 
I remain silent contemplate this predicament 
the rākṣasī serve I good food and as I eat it I sigh 
the rākṣasī ask I noble son why do you sigh 
Noble son what would you do in your homeland 
why be sorrowful in Jambudvīpa 
I say nothing in reply 
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara be Bālāha the king of horse and he rescue I from the fear of death 
I can not calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit but 
I can say just a little about his pore 
a trillion gandharvas dwell in a pore name Suvarṇa 
they perceive divine object but be free from attachment 
they have no aversion they do not become angry 
and they never have malice 
in this pore name Suvarṇa there be a wish fulfil jewel name Avabhāsa 
those rishis have leaf hut where there be wish fulfil tree with red trunk and gold and silver leave that shine like jewel 
sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin it be like this 
there be four pool near each wish fulfil tree 
they see birth aging and death 
they see separation from the desire and beloved and encounter with the disliked 
Bodhisattva Sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin say to the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat I be utterly astonish 
Bhagavat if those kind of thing appear just because someone think of the name of the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display 
then those who listen to cause to be write out possess recite study and have their mind completely focus on the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display will have happiness 
those who write a single letter from the precious king of the Mahāyāna sūtra the Sūtra of the Basket ’s Display will have happiness and 
will not see these suffering of saṃsāra 
the Bhagavat give his approval say that be excellent 
sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin your eloquence and your teaching of this kind of Dharma to a gathering of devas nāgas yakṣas gandharvas asura garuḍas kiṃnara mahoragas human nonhuman upāsakas and upāsikās be excellent excellent 
then Bodhisattva sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin say to the Bhagavat 
Bhagavat when you teach what I request the devas gain unwavering faith 
be beautiful and attractive 
have magnificent fair complexion 
their body be adorn with divine jewelry 
and they rival the apsarase 
even though they have this beauty they be not afflict by the suffering of desire 
Bhagavat if Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Samantabhadra do not see they 
why should I go 
as be a great yogin a sublime yogin 
as be with form a vast form a hundred thousand arm a trillion eye and eleven head 
Bhagavat how can I see Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
Noble son you will see he if he come here to the Sahā universe to look at I bow down to I and honor I 
I request it Bhagavat that Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara may come 
Noble son Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara first come when a being be ripen 
what point be there in my have a long life that be devoted to bad action deprive of the sight of Avalokiteśvara blind and follow a path of darkness 
Bhagavat when be Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara come 
the Bhagavat laugh and say noble son it be not yet time for Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara to come 
beyond that pore there be a pore name Amṛtabindu in that pore a million trillion devas live 
and some be on the tenth bodhisattva bhūmi 
within that pore name Amṛtabindu there be sixty mountain of gold and silver 
who be continuously play music 
within that pore name Amṛtabindu there be many million of trillion of extremely beautiful celestial palace completely adorn with divine jewel 
some be completely fill with flower and some be completely fill with blue lotus red lotus night lotus white lotus fragrant water lily tiger claw flower and great tiger claw flower 
be hang with diadem earring garland one hundred and eight string and sixty four string necklace 
and be perfectly hang with armlet and a variety of other adornment 
beyond that pore there be a pore name Vajramukha within it live many hundred of thousand of kiṃnaras 
beautify by necklace earring garland various jewelry and ointment 
there be many hundred of mountain within that pore 
some be make of diamond 
the kiṃnara relax in those celestial palace 
they each go to walk in their own walkway 
hang with diadem earring and garland 
hang with anklet 
hang with one hundred and eight string and sixty four string necklace 
and hang with string of jewel 
these wish fulfil tree around the walkway be like many storied mansion 
the kiṃnara contemplate in that way 
and follow that contemplation they contemplate the essence of nirvāṇa 
Bhagavat where can the six syllable mahāvidyā be obtain 
noble son even the tathāgata do not know the six syllable mahāvidyā let alone the bodhisattvas 
Bhagavat do the tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddhas not know it 
noble son the six syllable mahāvidyā be the supreme essence of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
Bhagavat be there any being who know the six syllable vidyāmantra 
Noble son no one know the six syllable mahāvidyā 
reside there they give their approval say excellent excellent noble son you have acquire such a wish fulfil jewel as this seven generation of your descendant will attain liberation noble son even all the being who live in your stomach will become irreversible bodhisattva 
will be know to be a stūpa contain relic 
and will be know to be the wisdom of ten million tathāgata 
woman man boy and girl who just see that person 
which be the inconceivable yoga and the immeasurable and high dhyāna 
which show the way to the nirvāṇa of supreme enlightenment 
which be the entranceway into liberation 
and which be the imperishable teaching of omniscience 
Bhagavat how can I obtain it 
would offer the four continent fill with the seven precious material to anyone who bestow upon I the six syllable mahāvidyā 
Bhagavat I have no concern for my body the one who bestow it upon I will be my parent my guru of guru 
at that time I go weeping to the Tathāgata the arhat the samyaksaṃbuddha the one with wisdom and conduct the sugata the knower of the world the unsurpassable guide who tame being the teacher of god and human the buddha the Bhagavat Ratnottama 
I place my palm together before he 
this six syllable mahāvidyā which purify all bad karma merely by the remembrance of its name 
then Tathāgata Padmottama praise the quality of this six syllable mahāvidyā 
as a comparison I can know the number of atom but 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
Noble son it be like this as a comparison I can count the grain of sand in the ocean but 
as a comparison a person build a building that be a hundred yojana high 
but noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
as a comparison if the people in the four continent be all to work at various kind of agriculture such as barley wheat rice green or black mung bean and so on and jujube horse gram and so on 
then noble son I could count every single grain 
as a comparison in Jambudvīpa there be great river that flow day and night 
they be the Sītā the Ganges the Yamuna the Indus the Pakṣu the Sutlej the Chenab the Ravi the Sumāgandha the Himavatī and the Godavari 
each of these river have five hundred tributary 
I can count each drop in those great river but 
noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
as a comparison I can count each hair on all four legged being such as herd of oxen donkey buffalo horse and elephant dog jackal goat and similarly lion tiger wolf deer monkey hare pig and so on and rat and cat and so on but 
as a comparison the king of mountain name Vajrāṅkuśa be 99,000 yojana high and extend downward into the sea for 84,000 yojana 
Noble son it be like this 
the ocean be 84,000 yojana deep and it have an immeasurable expanse extend as far as Vaḍavāmukha I can count all its drop of water which be the size of the tip of a hair but 
as a comparison I can count the number of leave in a forest of agarwood tree but noble son I can not calculate the accumulation of merit that come from repeat the six syllable mahāvidyā once 
as a comparison even if all the man woman boy and girl who live in the four continent be to be on the seventh bodhisattva bhūmi 
or with a leap month to make a year of thirteen month it be to rain day and night noble son I could count each drop of rain but 
there be no need to say much but if for example a million tathāgata like I be to be in one place for an eon provide with all requirement with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
still those tathāgata would not be able to calculate the accumulation of merit from the six syllable mahāvidyā 
so it be needless to say that I can not do so all by myself in this world 
Noble son I have enter the yoga of meditation through an inconceivable dhyāna 
an imperceptible Dharma an unknown Dharma it be the attainment of the ultimate essence 
Noble son I also wander through many hundred of thousand of million of ten of million of world and then 
in front of Tathāgata Amitābha with palm place together I weep because of my emotion for the Dharma 
at that time Tathāgata Amitābha who know the present and the future 
noble son who be unite with the yoga of meditation do you desire the six syllable queen of mahāvidyās 
I do desire it Bhagavat 
Bhagavat be my protector refuge and support 
Noble son look the Tathāgata the arhat the Samyaksaṃbuddha Padmottama have be to many million of trillion of world for the six syllable mahāvidyā the Tathāgata have travel like this noble son so therefore give he the six syllable queen of mahāvidyās 
how would one apprehend the Bhagavat ’s lotus hook hand gesture how would one know the Maṇidhara hand gesture 
these be the feature of the maṇḍala 
to create the body of Tathāgata Amitābha sprinkle powder make from precious sapphire powder emerald powder ruby powder crystal powder and powder silver and gold 
all vighna and vināyaka yakṣas and rākṣasa together with the company of mahākāla and mātṛs flee 
Meritorious be those being who with high motivation possess this six syllable mahāvidyā and repeat listen to and contemplate it 
the samādhi name Jewel Holder 
Bhagavat where can I go to obtain this mahāvidyā 
Bhagavat I will go to the great city of Vārāṇasī in order to see that dharmabhāṇaka to bow down to he and to honor he 
he should be see as be equal to the tathāgata see as be the life of the world

many million of trillion of bodhisattva come to make offering to you as do Brahmā Viṣṇu Maheśvara Āditya Candra Vāyu Varuṇa Agni Dharmarāja Yama and the four mahārājas 
those who indulge in the affliction create the realm of being and have the characteristic of saṃsāra 
those who know the six syllable mahāvidyā will not be pollute by desire anger or stupidity 
give I the opportunity of the Dharma give I the pure body of perfectly establish form give I a good reputation so that all being say he have gain unwavering goodness 
be my protector refuge and support 
Noble son people be ordain in various order and be ordain in the various garment of those seek liberation

possess its name just once will make they equal to someone who have provide all the tathāgata with all requisite with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil 
see someone who have a body white as the autumn moon a crown of coil hair an omniscient buddha upon his head and a beautiful lotus in his hand and be adorn with the splendor of lotus 
Noble son the Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara have give permission for the six syllable queen of mahāvidyās to be give to you 
sarva­nīvaraṇa­viṣkambhin attain these samādhis 
the samādhi name Unceasing True Nature

at that time they be sit cross - legged 
they contemplate sadness concern the body thinking 
in those many storied palace there be seat tathāgata who teach the Dharma to the human in Jambudvīpa

thus noble son they see the pore of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara they also see deity such as devas nāgas yakṣas asura garuḍas kiṃnara mahoragas human nonhuman Maheśvara and Nārāyaṇa assemble in Jetavana Monastery and many million of trillion of bodhisattva assemble there 
Bhagavat be there no other pore

their depth be immeasurable 
when water come from the right big toe it fall on Vaḍavāmukha 
Bhagavat be there yet another pore 
there be no more noble son 
Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara will come to this great monastery of Jetavana in order to see I to bow down to I to honor I and to give a prophecy concern the deity Maheśvara in a realm within this universe

the deva Maheśvara praise Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara in that way and then sit silently

I can calculate noble son the number part and group of how many pala be in those mountain how many hundred of pala or thousand of pala or million of trillion of pala but 
noble son I can not calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit 
I can count each leaf in a forest of agarwood tree but 
I can not calculate Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara ’s accumulation of merit 
if someone be to provide tathāgata arhat and samyaksaṃbuddha as numerous as the grain of sand in twelve Ganges Rivers with robe food bowl bed seat necessary medicine and utensil for an eon the accumulation of merit that would come from serve those tathāgata would only equal the merit of the tip of one hair on the body of Bodhisattva Mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara 
the samādhi name Adorning

at that time I be a bodhisattva
